<p class="tb">Historical material in this book comes from action
reports, squadron histories, and other naval
records on file at the historical records section in
Arlington, Va. Most valuable was the comprehensive
history of PT actions written by Commodore
Robert Bulkley for the Navy. The Bulkley history
was in manuscript form at the time I did research
for this book. The broad outline of naval history
comes mostly from the <i>History of U. S. Naval Operations
in World War II</i> of Samuel Eliot Morison.
I am grateful to several PT veterans for their generous
contribution of diaries, letters, anecdotes, etc.,
which have been drawn on for human interest material.
Among these kind correspondents are: James
Cunningham of Shreveport, La., Roger Jones of
Nassau, Bahama Islands, Lieut. Commander R. W.
Brown of Scituate, Mass., Capt. Stanley Barnes of
the War College, Carlisle Barracks, Pa., James Newberry
of Memphis, Tenn., and Arthur Murray Preston,
of Washington, D. C. The officers of Peter Tare
Inc., a PT veterans organization, have been helpful.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The First PTs: Facts and Fictions</span></h2>
<p>In March 17, 1942, General Douglas MacArthur
arrived safely in Australia after a flight from
his doomed army in the Philippine Islands. The
people of America, staggering from three months
of unrelieved disaster, felt a tremendous lift of
spirits.</p>
<p>America needed a lift of spirits.</p>
<p>Three months before, without the formality of
declaring war, Japan had sneaked a fleet of planes
from a carrier force into the main American naval
base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and in one Sunday
morning&rsquo;s work the planes had smashed America&rsquo;s
Pacific battle line under a shower of bombs and
torpedoes. Without a fighting fleet, America had
been helpless to stop the swift spread of the Japanese
around the far shores and islands of the Pacific
basin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Guam and Wake Island had been overrun;
Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, the East Indies, had
been gobbled up. Our fighting sailors, until the disaster
of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, had been
boasting around the navy clubs that the American
fleet could sail up one side of the Japanese homeland
and down the other side, shooting holes in the
islands and watching them sink from sight. Now
they ground their teeth in humiliation and rage, unable
to get at the Japanese because the Pacific
Fleet battle line lay in the ooze on the bottom of
Pearl Harbor. His Imperial Japanese Majesty&rsquo;s
navy was steaming, virtually unopposed, wherever
its infuriatingly cocky admirals willed.</p>
<p>When a combined Dutch-American flotilla had
tried to block the Japanese landings on Java, the
Allied navies had promptly lost 13 of their pitifully
few remaining destroyers and cruisers&mdash;and the
tragic sacrifice had not even held up the Japanese
advance for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>The naval officers of the Allies had had to make a
painful change in their opinion of the Japanese
sailor&rsquo;s ability; he had turned out to be a formidable
fighting man.</p>
<p>On land, the Japanese army was even more
spectacularly competent. Years of secret training
in island-hopping and jungle warfare had paid off
for the Japanese. With frightening ease, they had
brushed aside opposition everywhere&mdash;everywhere,
that is, except in the Philippine Islands, where
General MacArthur&rsquo;s outnumbered and underequipped
Filipino and American fighters had improvised
a savage resistance; had patched together
a kind of Hooligan&rsquo;s Army, fleshing out the thin
ranks of the defenders with headquarters clerks
and ship&rsquo;s cooks, with electrician&rsquo;s mates and
chaplain&rsquo;s assistants, with boatless boatswain&rsquo;s
mates and planeless pilots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s patchwork army had harried the
Japanese advance and had stubbornly fought a long
retreat down the Island of Luzon. It was bottled
up on the Bataan Peninsula and on the island
fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay, and it was
already doomed, everybody knew that. The flight
of its commanding general only emphasized that it
had been written off, but the tremendous fight it
was putting up had salved every American&rsquo;s
wounded national pride. Besides, the very fact
that MacArthur had been ordered out of the islands
clearly meant that America was going back, once
the nation had caught its breath and recovered from
Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>General MacArthur, with a talent for flamboyant
leadership that amounted to genius of a sort, emitted
the sonorous phrase: &ldquo;I shall return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few sour critics, immune to the MacArthur
charm, deplored his use of the first person singular
when the first person plural would have been more
graceful&mdash;and more accurate&mdash;but the phrase caught
on in the free world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall return.&rdquo; The phrase promised brave
times ahead, when the galling need to retreat
would end and America would begin the journey
back to Bataan.</p>
<p>A stirring prospect, but what a long journey it
was going to be. The most ignorant could look at a
map and see that MacArthur&rsquo;s return trip was
going to take years. And yet his trip out had taken
only days. A few of the curious wondered how his
escape had been engineered. News stories said that
MacArthur had flown into Australia. But where
had he found a plane? For days America had been
told that on the shrinking Luzon beachhead no airstrips
remained in American hands. Where had
MacArthur gone to find a friendly airfield, and how
had he gone there through the swarming patrols of
the Japanese naval blockade?</p>
<p>The full story of MacArthur&rsquo;s escape, when it
was told, became one of the top adventure stories
of World War II.</p>
<p>First came the bare announcement that it was on
a motor torpedo boat&mdash;a PT boat in Navy parlance,
and a mosquito boat in journalese&mdash;that the
general had made the first leg of his flight across
enemy-infested seas. Then a crack journalist named
William L. White interviewed the officers of the PT
rescue squadron and wrote a book about the escape
and about the days when the entire American
naval striking force in the Philippines had shrunk
to six, then four, then three, then one of the barnacle-encrusted
plywood motorboats hardly bigger
than a stockbroker&rsquo;s cabin cruiser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The book was called <i>They Were Expendable</i>,
and it became a runaway best-seller. It was condensed
for <i>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</i> and featured in <i>Life</i>
Magazine, and it made the PT sailor the glamour
boy of America&rsquo;s surface fleet. <i>They Were Expendable</i>
makes exciting reading today, but the book&rsquo;s
success spawned a swarm of magazine and newspaper
articles about the PT navy, and some of
them were distressingly irresponsible. Quite innocently,
William White himself added to the PT&rsquo;s
exaggerated reputation for being able to lick all
comers, regardless of size. He wrote his book
in wartime and so had no way of checking the
squadron&rsquo;s claims of torpedo successes. Naturally,
as any generous reporter would have done, he
gave full credit to its claims of an amazing bag&mdash;two
light cruisers, two transports and an oil tanker,
besides enemy barges, landing craft and planes.</p>
<p>Postwar study of Japanese naval archives shows
no evidence that any Japanese ships were torpedoed
at the times and places the Squadron Three
sailors claim to have hit them. Of course, airplane
and PT pilots are notoriously overoptimistic&mdash;they
have to be optimistic by nature even to get
into the cockpits of their frail craft and set out for
combat. And yet any realistic person who has
worked in government archives hesitates to give
full weight to a damage assessment by an office
research clerk as opposed to the evidence of combat
eyewitnesses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Postwar evaluation specialists would not confirm
the sinking of a 5,000-ton armed merchant vessel at
Binanga on January 19, 1942, but Army observers on
Mount Mariveles watched through 20-power glasses
as a ship sank, and they reported even the number
and caliber of the guns in its armament.</p>
<p>On February 2, 1942, Army lookouts reported
that a badly crippled cruiser was run aground (and
later cut up for scrap) at the right time and place
to be the cruiser claimed by PT 32. Evaluation
clerks could not find a record of this ship sinking
either, so the PT claim is denied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the most elaborately detailed
claim of all, the sinking of a <i>Kuma</i> class cruiser
off Cebu Island by PTs 34 and 41, most certainly is
not valid, because the cruiser itself sent a full report
of the battle to Japanese Navy headquarters and
admitted being struck by one dud torpedo (so much
at least of the PT claim is true), but the cruiser,
which happened to be the <i>Kuma</i> itself, was undamaged
and survived to be sunk by a British
submarine late in the war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The undeniable triumph of Squadron Three was
the flight of MacArthur. On March 11, 1942, at
Corregidor, the four surviving boats of the squadron
picked up the general, his staff and selected
officers and technicians, the general&rsquo;s wife and son
and&mdash;most astonishingly&mdash;a Chinese nurse for the
four-year-old boy. In a series of night dashes from
island to island through Japanese-infested seas, the
little flotilla carried the escaping brass to the island
of Mindanao, where the generals and admirals
caught a B 17 Flying Fortress bomber flight for
Australia.</p>
<p>The fantastic and undeniably exaggerated claims
of sinkings are regrettable, but in no way detract
from the bravery of the sailors of Squadron Three.
They were merely the victims of the nation&rsquo;s desperate
need for victories.</p>
<p>William White&rsquo;s contribution to the false giant-killer
image of the PTs is understandable, but other
correspondents were less responsible. One, famous
and highly respected, said that all PTs were armed
with three-inch cannon. Putting such a massive
weapon on the fragile plywood deck of a PT boat
was a bit like arming a four-year-old boy with a
big-league baseball bat&mdash;it&rsquo;s just too much weapon
for such a little fellow to carry. The same reckless
writer said that PT boats cruised at 70 knots. Another
said that a PT could pace a new car&mdash;which
amounts to another claim for a 70-knot speed. Almost
all of the reporters, some of whom surely
knew better, wrote about the PTs&rsquo; armament as
though the little boats could slug it out with ships of
the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>In the fantasies spun by the nation&rsquo;s press, the
PTs literally ran rings around enemy destroyers
and socked so many torpedoes into Japanese warships
that you almost felt sorry for the outclassed
and floundering enemy.</p>
<p>PT sailors read these romances and gritted their
teeth. They knew too painfully well that the stories
were not true.</p>
<p>What was the truth about the PT?</p>
<p>Early in World War II, before the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States into
the war then raging in Europe against Germany
and Italy and in China against Japan, the American
Navy had been tinkering around with various designs
of fast small boats armed with torpedoes.
British coastal forces had been making good use of
small, fast torpedo boats, and the American Navy
borrowed much from British designs.</p>
<p>On July 24, 1941&mdash;four and a half months before
America entered the war&mdash;the Navy held the
Plywood Derby, a test speed run of experimental
PTs in the open Atlantic off Long Island. The
course ran around the east end of Block Island,
around the Fire Island lightship to a finish line
at Montauk Point Whistling Buoy. Two PTs of
the Elco design finished with best average speeds&mdash;39.72
and 37.01 knots&mdash;but boats of other designs
had smaller turning circles. Over a measured mile
the Elcos did 45.3 knots with a light load and
44.1 knots with a heavy load.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>On a second Plywood Derby, the Elcos raced
against the destroyer <i>Wilkes</i>. Seas were running
eight feet high&mdash;in one stretch the destroyer skipper
reported 15-foot waves&mdash;and the little cockleshells
took a terrible beating. Most of the time
they were out of sight in the trough of the seas
or hidden by flying spray. The destroyer won the
race, but the Navy board had been impressed by
the seaworthiness of the tough little boats, and the
Navy decided to go ahead with a torpedo-boat
program. The board standardized on the 80-foot
Elco and the 78-foot Higgins designs, and
the boatyards fell to work.</p>
<p>The boats were built of layers of plywood. Draft
to the tips of the propellers was held to a shallow
five feet six inches, so that the PT could sneak close
to an enemy beach on occasion as a kind of seagoing
cavalry, to do dirty work literally at the crossroads.</p>
<p>Three Packard V-12 engines gave a 4,500-shaft
horsepower and drove the boats, under ideal conditions,
as fast as 45 knots&mdash;but conditions were
seldom ideal. A PT in the battle zone was almost
never in top racing form. In action the PT was usually
overloaded, was often running on jury-rig repairs
and spare parts held together with adhesive
tape and ingenuity. In tropic waters the hull was
soon sporting a long, green beard of water plants
that could cut the PT&rsquo;s speed in half. Many of the
PTs that fought the bloody battles that follow in
these pages were doing well to hit 29 or even 27
knots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The American Navy had learned the hard way
that any enemy destroyer could make 35 knots,
and many of them could do considerably better&mdash;plenty
fast enough to run down a PT boat, especially
after a few months of action had cut the
PT&rsquo;s speed.</p>
<p>The normal boat crew was three officers and
14 men, though the complement varied widely
under combat conditions. The boat carried enough
provisions for about five days.</p>
<p>As for that bristling armament the correspondents
talked about, a PT boat originally carried four
torpedoes and tubes, and two 50-caliber twin machine-gun
mounts. In combat PT skippers improvised
installation of additional weapons, and by
the war&rsquo;s end all boats had added some combination
of 40-mm. autocannon, 37-mm. cannon, 20-mm.
antiaircraft autocannon, rocket launchers, and
60-mm. mortars. In some zones they even discarded
the torpedoes and added still more
automatic weapons, to give themselves heavier
broadsides for duels with armed enemy small craft.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, the PT boat was by far the
most heavily armed vessel afloat, but that does not
mean that a PT flyweight, no matter how tough for
its size, was a match for an enemy heavyweight.
PT sailors never hesitated to tackle an enemy
destroyer, but they knew that a torpedo boat
could stand up to an all-out brawl with an alert and
aroused destroyer the way a spunky rat terrier can
stand up to a hungry wolf. After all, the full and
proper name of a destroyer is <i>torpedo-boat</i> destroyer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The PT&rsquo;s main tactic was not the hell-roaring
dash of the correspondents&rsquo; romances, but a sneaky,
quiet approach in darkness or fog. The PT was designed
to slip slowly and quietly into an enemy
formation in bad visibility, to fire torpedoes at the
handiest target, and to escape behind a smoke
screen with whatever speed the condition of the
boat permitted. With luck, the screening destroyers
would lose the PT in the smoke, the confusion,
and the darkness. Without luck&mdash;well, in warfare
everybody has to take some chances.</p>
<p>What most annoyed the PT sailors about their
lurid press was that the truth made an even
better story. After all, they argued, it takes guts to
ease along at night in an agonizingly slow approach
to an enemy warship that will chew you to bloody
splinters if the lookouts ever spot you. And it takes
real courage to bore on into slingshot range when
you know that the enemy can easily run you down
if your torpedoes miss or fail to explode, as they
did all too often. Compared to this reality, one of
those imaginary 70-knot blitzes would be a breeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>One disgusted PT sailor wrote: &ldquo;Publicity has
reached the point where glorified stories are not
genuinely flattering. Most PT men resent the wild,
fanciful tales that tend to belittle their real experience....
There is actually little glamour for a
PT. The excitement of battle is tempered by many
dull days of inactivity, long nights of fruitless patrol,
and dreary hours of foul weather at sea in a
small boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He griped that the PT sailor would prefer the
tribute of &ldquo;They were dependable&rdquo; to &ldquo;They were
expendable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe so, but the public just would not have it
that way. The dash and audacity of the sailors of
those little boats had appealed to the American
mind. It was the story of David and Goliath again,
and the sailors in the slingshot navy, no matter how
they balked, joined the other wild and woolly heroes
of legend who go joyously into battle against
giants.</p>
<p>This is the story of what the mosquito fleet
really did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Attrition at Guadalcanal</span></h2>
<p>In August 7, 1942, exactly eight months after
Pearl Harbor, American Marines landed on
Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands, as the
first step on the long road to Tokyo. The Japanese
reacted violently. They elected to have it out right
there&mdash;to stop the Allied recovery right at the
start and at all costs.</p>
<p>Down from their mighty base at Rabaul, they
sent reinforcements and supplies through a sea lane
flanked by two parallel rows of islands in the Solomons
archipelago. The sea lane quickly became
known as The Slot, and the supply ships, usually
fast destroyers, became known as the Tokyo Express.</p>
<p>The night runs of the Tokyo Express were wearing
down the Marines. As they became more and
more dirty and tired they became more and more
irritated to find that the Japanese they killed
were dressed in spruce new uniforms&mdash;sure sign
that they were newcomers to the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Even worse was the sleep-robbing uproar of the
night naval bombardments that pounded planes and
installations at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal,
the only American base where friendly fighters and
bombers could find a home. The American hold on
the island was in danger from sheer physical
fatigue.</p>
<p>The American and Japanese fleets clashed in the
waters around the Guadalcanal landing beaches in
a series of bloody surface battles that devoured
ships and men on both sides in a hideous contest of
attrition. Whichever side could hang on fifteen seconds
longer than the other&mdash;whichever side could
stand to lose one more ship and one more sailor&mdash;was
going to win.</p>
<p>At the very moment of one of the big cruiser-destroyer
clashes (October 11-12, 1942)&mdash;officially
called the Battle of Cape Esperance&mdash;American
naval reinforcements of a sort arrived in the area.
Forty miles east of the battle, four fresh, unbloodied
fighting ships were sailing into Tulagi Harbor at
Florida Island, just across a narrow strait from
Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>It was half of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron
Three, four PT boats, the first American torpedo
boats to arrive in combat waters since the last
boat of Lieut. John Bulkeley&rsquo;s disbanded Squadron
Three had been burned in the Philippines seven
months before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>

<p class="caption">SOLOMON ISLANDS</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The PT sailors came topside as they entered the
harbor to watch the flash of cannonading in the sky
to the west where American and Japanese sailors
were blowing each other to bloody bits. For them,
training time was over, the shooting time was now,
and the PT navy was once again on the firing line.</p>
<p>All day on October 13, the PT sailors scurried
about, getting the little warships ready for a fight.
Their preparations made only a ripple in the maelstrom
of activity around the islands.</p>
<p>Coast watchers&mdash;friendly observers who hid on
islands behind the Japanese lines and reported by
radio on ship and plane movements&mdash;reported a
new menace to Guadalcanal. They had spotted a
Japanese naval force coming down The Slot, but
they said it was made up only of destroyers.</p>
<p>When Lieut. Commander Alan R. Montgomery,
the PT squadron commander at Tulagi, heard that
only destroyers were coming, he begged off from
the fight&mdash;on the extraordinary grounds that he
preferred waiting for bigger game.</p>
<p>Montgomery&rsquo;s decision is not as cocky as it
first sounds. The Japanese presumably did not know
about the arrival of the PTs on the scene, and if
ever a PT was going to shoot a torpedo into a big
one&mdash;a cruiser or a battleship&mdash;it was going to
be by surprise. No use tipping off the enemy until
the big chance came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The big chance was really on the way. The coast
watchers had underestimated the size of the Japanese
force. It was actually built around a pair of
battleships, escorted by cruisers and destroyers, all
bent on pounding Henderson Field and its pesky
planes out of existence.</p>
<p>The Japanese command obviously expected no
American naval resistance, because ammunition
hoists of the Japanese fleet were loaded with a new
kind of thin-skinned shell especially designed for
blowing into jagged fragments that would slice
planes and people to useless shreds. The bombardment
shells would not be much use against armor.
The Japanese ammunition load would have been a
disaster for the task force if it had run into armored
opposition&mdash;cruisers or battleships of the American
Navy&mdash;but the Japanese knew as well as we
did that there was little likelihood our badly
mauled fleet, manned by exhausted sailors, would
be anywhere near the scene. The Japanese sailed
down The Slot with one hand voluntarily tied behind
them, in a sense, supremely confident that
they could pound Henderson Field Without interference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Shortly after midnight on October 14th, two
Japanese battleships opened up on Henderson
Field with gigantic 14-inch rifles shooting the special
fragmentation and incendiary shells. The two
battleships were accompanied by a cruiser and
either eight or nine destroyers. A Japanese scouting
plane dropped flares to make the shooting easier.
An American searchlight at Lunga Point, on Guadalcanal,
probed over the water, looking for the
Japanese, but American 5-inch guns&mdash;the largest
American guns ashore&mdash;were too short of range to
reach the battleships and cruisers even if the searchlight
had found them. The big ships hove to and
poured in a merciless cascade of explosive.</p>
<p>For almost an hour and a half, Marines, soldiers
and Seabees lay in foxholes and suffered while the
Cyclopean 14-inchers tore holes in the field, riddled
planes with shell fragments, started fires and
filled the air with shards from exploding shell casings&mdash;shards
that could slice a man in two without
even changing the pitch of his screams.</p>
<p>At the PT base in Tulagi, Lieut. Commander
Montgomery was awakened by the din across the
way. He knew that no destroyer force could make
that kind of uproar. The earth-shaking cannonading
meant that the big boys were shooting up Guadalcanal,
blithely assuming that the U. S. Navy was
not present.</p>
<p>But it was. Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three
was on the scene and waiting for just such a target.</p>
<p>Montgomery called in his four young skippers&mdash;Lieuts.
(jg) Henry S. (Stilly) Taylor of PT 46, Robert
C. Wark of PT 48, John M. Searles of PT 60, and
his brother Robert Searles of PT 38.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning of October 14th,
Commander Montgomery ordered: &ldquo;Prepare for
action. All boats under way immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>It was the first combat order given to PT boats
since the debacle in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The PTs left the harbor together but scattered
quickly. They had all spotted the Japanese bombardment
fleet by the orange flashes of its guns,
and they lost each other in the darkness as they
deployed to attack.</p>
<p>Somebody on a Japanese cruiser must have been
at least mildly nervous, for a searchlight came on,
swept the water toward Tulagi, zipped right
across Bob Searles in 38, and then went black.
Searles stretched his luck; he cut his speed to 10
knots and began a slow stalk of the cruiser that
had muffed its chance to sound the alarm.</p>
<p>So cocky were the Japanese that the cruiser was
almost dead in the water; even at 10 knots, the 38
closed the range from behind.</p>
<p>Bob Searles greased the 38 along the still waters
of the sound, holding his breath and dreading to see
the glare of that searchlight again. He could see the
target clearly silhouetted in the gun flashes, and it
was a brute&mdash;a light cruiser, Bob thought, judging
from its shape, its size, and the roar of its guns.
Searles figured that he would probably be the first
and only PT skipper to enjoy the carefully preserved
surprise that the PT sailors hoped would
bag them a big one&mdash;so he had to make his first
shot good or waste the chance they had all been
hoarding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>A torpedo, like any other weapon that has to be
aimed, is more likely to hit the closer you get to
your target before you shoot. So Bob went in to 400
yards in stealthy silence. Four hundred yards in a
naval battle is the equivalent of arm&rsquo;s length in an
infantry fire fight. At 400 yards, a spread of torpedoes
will usually score, but the machine guns and
autocannon of a cruiser&rsquo;s secondary battery, guided
by a searchlight, will almost certainly tear up a
torpedo boat. Searles, just to be sure of a hit, was
doing the same thing as a commando would do if,
armed with a high-powered rifle, he crept to within
five feet of a sentry armed with a sawed-off shotgun.
At any range that rifle is a deadly weapon&mdash;like a
torpedo&mdash;but at close range the shotgun is just as
deadly and ten times surer of hitting with the first
shot.</p>
<p>At 400 yards Bob fired two fish. He chased along
behind them to 200-yard range&mdash;almost rock-throwing
range&mdash;and fired his last two torpedoes.
The instant he felt the boat jump from those shots,
he poured on the coal and roared past the cruiser,
100 yards astern. As they went by, all hands topside
on the PT felt the scorching blast of a double explosion
forward of the cruiser&rsquo;s bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The surprise was over. From here on the whole
Japanese task force would be alarmed and shooting
back&mdash;but that big boy the PT sailors had been
after was in the bag. The 38&rsquo;s crew was sure of it.
Searles had the good sense not to hang around the
hornet&rsquo;s nest he had stirred up. His torpedoes
were gone anyhow, so he lit out for home, convinced
that he had scored the first PT victory of the
comeback trail.</p>
<p>The other PTs had scattered, looking for other
targets in the dark. There were plenty of targets,
for they had penetrated the destroyer screen,
without either side knowing it, and were in the
heart of the Japanese formation. After the blast
from the 38&rsquo;s torpedo attack on the cruiser, the PTs
themselves were as much targets as they were
hunters.</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Montgomery, riding with
John Searles on the 60, was stalking a big ship&mdash;possibly
the same cruiser Bob Searles had already
attacked&mdash;but the escorting destroyers were roiled
up and rallying around.</p>
<p>A searchlight poked about the water, looking for
the 60 which had probably been dimly spotted by
a lookout. The searchlight never found the 60, but
it did silhouette the PT for another destroyer. Japanese
shells from the second destroyer screamed
over the PT, but Montgomery held steadily to his
attack course on the cruiser&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;until
two of the 60&rsquo;s fish were off and running.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>John Searles spun the rudder over hard left and
shoved the throttles up to the stops. Smoke
poured from the generator on the stern, to cover
their escape, and so the crew of the 60 didn&rsquo;t see
the end of the torpedo run, but it claimed a hit,
anyhow, from the sound of a massive explosion.</p>
<p>If it was a torpedo hit and if the hit was on the
same cruiser Bob Searles said he hit, that cruiser
was in sad shape. Not so the destroyers. They were
full of fight and boring in on the 60.</p>
<p>Smoke makes a fine screen for covering escape,
but only for a time. After the initial escape is successful,
a continuing smoke cloud only marks the
course of the fleeing PT boat, just as a tracer&rsquo;s
phosphorescent trail tracks a bullet through the
night. So Montgomery shut off the smoke when he
thought they were free, but he had waited a moment
too long.</p>
<p>Just as the smoke-screen generator hissed to a
halt, a destroyer pinned the 60 down in the blue
glare of a searchlight and a salvo of Japanese shells,
landing 20 feet astern, almost lifted the 60 out of
the water.</p>
<p>The Japanese destroyer captain did not know it,
probably still doesn&rsquo;t know it if he is even alive, but
when he turned his light on the 60, he simultaneously
lost the chance to sink one PT boat by
ramming and just possibly saved his own ship from
being sunk by still another PT.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Robert Wark&rsquo;s 48 was sneaking up on the destroyer
in a torpedo attack on one side; Henry
Taylor&rsquo;s 46 was roaring across the water, looking
for targets on the other side, quite unaware that the
destroyer was in its path. When the searchlight
glare hit the 60, Taylor saw the Japanese ship
dead ahead and put the rudder of the 46 over hard.
He barely missed a collision with the can, a collision
that would have reduced his little warship
to a floating carpet of matchsticks. But, in
skimming by the destroyer, Taylor almost rammed
Wark&rsquo;s 48 and spoiled its torpedo attack. Wark
lost contact with the destroyer in the wild careering
around the sound that followed the double near-collision,
and he didn&rsquo;t get off his torpedoes.</p>
<p>The whole time the Japanese captain was so intent
on sinking the 60, pinned down by his searchlight,
he apparently missed the near-collisions right
under his nose. His shells were creeping up the
wake of the fleeting 60 and he doggedly plowed
into the stream of 50-caliber bullets from the PT
antiaircraft machine-gun battery, willing to take
the punishment in exchange for a chance to run
the torpedo boat down.</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Montgomery turned on the
smoke generator again and had the inspiration to
drop two depth charges into his wake. The charges
exploded just ahead of the Japanese destroyer, and
the Japanese skipper shied away from the chase,
fearful that the closer he got to the PT boat, the
more likely he was to be blown in two by a
depth charge right under the bridge. The 60 escaped
in the smoke, lay close to the beach for
the rest of that night, and drifted aground on a
coral reef near morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Wark, who had picked up his original target
again, was still trying to shoot a fish into the destroyer
that had abandoned the chase of the 60.
Wark did not know it, but he was himself being
stalked. From 200 yards away, a Japanese destroyer
caught the 48 in a searchlight beam and fired all the
guns that would bear.</p>
<p>A searchlight beam is a two-edged tool. It helps
the aim of the gunners on the destroyer; at the same
time it makes a beautiful mark for the PT&rsquo;s machine
guns. C. E. Todd, the ship&rsquo;s cook, pumped
50-caliber bullets into the destroyer&rsquo;s bridge and
superstructure until the light was shattered. The
destroyer disappeared and nobody knows what
damage it suffered, but it is highly improbable
that it could be raked by 50-caliber fire from 200
yards away without serious damage and casualties.</p>
<p>The 48&rsquo;s skipper could say: &ldquo;He never laid a
glove on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Aboard the Japanese flagship, the admiral, apparently
alarmed by unexpected naval resistance
no matter how puny, ordered a cease fire and a
withdrawal. Eighty minutes of shellfire had left
Henderson Field in a shambles anyhow. Forever
after, Guadalcanal veterans of the night between
October 13 and 14, 1942, talked about The Bombardment&mdash;not
the bombardment of this date or
the bombardment of that date. Simply The Bombardment.
Everybody knew which one they meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>What had the PTs accomplished on their first
sortie? Bob and John Searles claimed solid hits on a
cruiser. Postwar assessment of claims says that
there is &ldquo;no conclusive evidence that any major
Japanese ship was sunk&rdquo; on that night. But the next
day a coast watcher reported that natives had seen
a large warship sink off the New Georgia coast,
to the north on the withdrawal route. Radio Tokyo
itself acknowledged the loss of a cruiser that night
under the attack of &ldquo;nineteen torpedo boats of
which we destroyed fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last bit&mdash;public admission by the Japanese
of the loss of a cruiser to a PT&mdash;is the most
convincing. The Japanese played down their own
losses ridiculously. Sometimes they even believed
their own propaganda, so much so that they deployed
for battle forces which had been destroyed
but whose loss they had never admitted,
even to themselves.</p>
<p>A curious incident during the almost nightly naval
bombardments of Henderson Field shows the Japanese
sailor&rsquo;s fatal desire to believe his own propaganda.
Eight Japanese destroyers and a light cruiser
bombarded the field the night of October 25, 1942.
They sank two small ships, but they called off
the shore bombardment after only a feeble effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The reason?</p>
<p>A Japanese officer ashore had sent a message:
<span class="smaller">BANZAI. OCCUPIED AIRFIELD AT</span> 2300.</p>
<p>He had done no such thing. Indeed, the very
planes spared by that spurious message sank the
cruiser the next morning.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more important result of the first PT
foray than the hit on a cruiser was the shock to the
Japanese nervous system. The Japanese navy had an
inordinate horror of torpedo boats&mdash;possibly because
the Japanese themselves were so diabolically
good at surface torpedo attack. The knowledge that
American torpedo boats were back on the scene
must have been a jolt to their sensitivities.</p>
<p>Nobody can prove that the Japanese admiral
called off the bombardment because of the torpedo
attacks&mdash;after all, he had already shot up Henderson
Field for eighty minutes and had expended
almost all his special bombardment ammunition&mdash;but
it is a remarkable coincidence that the shooting
stopped almost immediately after the PTs arrived,
and the withdrawal followed soon after the torpedoes
started swimming around.</p>
<p>Half an hour after their sortie from Tulagi, the
PTs saw a vast armada of Japanese ships turn tail
and leave the field to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The Marines didn&rsquo;t quibble. They crawled out
of their foxholes, those who could, and thanked God
for whoever had run off the 14-inchers. Henderson
Field had survived, but barely, and the Marines
were willing to give anybody credit for running
off the battleships, if whoever it was would just
keep them off. The PTs were willing to try.</p>
<p>The night between October 14th and 15th was the
low point of the Navy&rsquo;s contribution to the Guadalcanal
campaign. Two Japanese cruisers insolently
pounded Henderson Field with 752 eight-inch
shells, and the Navy could not lift a finger to stop
them. The only Navy fighting ships in the area
were the four PTs of Squadron Three, but the 60
was still aground on a reef, the 38 had left all of
its torpedoes inside a Japanese cruiser the night
before, and the other two PTs were escorting two
little supply ships across the channel between
Tulagi and Guadalcanal. The cruisers had a field
day.</p>
<p>The next night two Japanese cruisers fired 1,500
punishing eight-inch shells at Henderson Field.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, in Washington,
after studying the battle report, could say only:
&ldquo;Everybody <i>hopes</i> we can hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admiral Chester Nimitz was even more grim.
&ldquo;It now appears that we are unable to control the
sea in the Guadalcanal area. Thus our supply of the
positions will only be done at great expense to us.
The situation is not hopeless, but it is certainly
critical.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Perhaps the PTs had arrived too late to do
any good. Certainly a navy that consisted of three
torpedo boats afloat and one on a reef was not
going to win the battle for Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>The Japanese, beginning on November 2nd, spent
a week running destroyer and cruiser deckloads of
soldiers down The Slot&mdash;65 destroyer deckloads
and two cruiser loads in all.</p>
<p>On November 8th, PTs hit the destroyer <i>Mochizuki</i>
but did not sink it.</p>
<p>This kind of reinforcement by dribbles was not
fast enough to satisfy the Japanese brass, so they
planned to stop sending a boy to do a man&rsquo;s job. At
Truk, they organized a mighty task force of two
light carriers, four battleships, 11 cruisers and 36
destroyers to escort 11 fast transports to Guadalcanal
on November 14th.</p>
<p>Before risking the transports, jammed with soldiers
to be landed at Tassafaronga, the Japanese
planned to bombard Henderson Field for two
straight nights to eliminate once and for all the
dangerous Marine airplanes based there.</p>
<p>The climactic sea struggle for Guadalcanal began
on the night of November 12, 1942.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>American scouting planes and Allied coast
watchers sent word that a frighteningly powerful
bombardment force was on its way down The
Slot, and the most optimistic defenders of Guadalcanal
wondered if this was going to be the end.
Two Japanese battleships, the <i>Hiei</i> and the
<i>Kirishima</i>, a cruiser, and fourteen destroyers
were in the Japanese fleet. (The Japanese had
learned to fear the PT boats of Tulagi; the fleet
commander had posted two destroyers on one advanced
flank and three destroyers on the other, as
a torpedo-boat screen. In addition, he had assigned
three other destroyers, not counted among
the 14 under his direct command, to rove ahead
on an anti-PT patrol.)</p>
<p>In a swirling, half-hour action on Friday, November
13th&mdash;the opening of the three-day naval Battle
of Guadalcanal&mdash;the United States Navy lost
the cruiser <i>Atlanta</i>, the destroyers <i>Barton</i>, <i>Cushing</i>,
<i>Laffey</i>, and <i>Monssen</i>, and suffered severe damage
to the cruisers <i>Portland</i>, <i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Helena</i>,
<i>Juneau</i>, and to three destroyers. Admiral Daniel J.
Callaghan was killed.</p>
<p>Limping home after the battle, the cruiser <i>Juneau</i>
was torpedoed by the submarine I-26 (whose skipper
admits that he was aiming at another ship entirely).
The <i>Juneau</i> disappeared in a blast of smoke
and flame. In one of the most tragic and inexplicable
misadventures of the war, the survivors of the
<i>Juneau</i>, floating within easy reach of the PTs at
Tulagi, were abandoned, and no attempt was
made to rescue them until all but a handful had
died of exposure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>It is possible that the PTs&mdash;excellent rescue
craft manned by sailors eager to help stricken shipmates&mdash;were
so new to the theatre that the top
brass didn&rsquo;t even know of their presence, or at least
weren&rsquo;t in the habit of thinking about them. At any
rate, the PTs were tied up at Tulagi while American
sailors drowned almost within sight of the harbor.</p>
<p>On the night between November 13th and 14th,
two Japanese heavy cruisers, screened by a light
cruiser and four destroyers, steamed toward Guadalcanal
with another load of bombardment shells.</p>
<p>The situation on Guadalcanal was grave. The
base was crammed with the sick and weary survivors
of the naval battle. The veteran defenders knew
another punishing flotilla was on its way with possibly
the final, fatal load of fragmentation shells
aboard&mdash;and there were no big American ships
near enough to say them nay.</p>
<p>The United States Navy had almost shot its bolt,
at least temporarily. Almost but not quite.</p>
<p>Two PTs were still in the fight.</p>
<p>One, commanded by Stilly Taylor, and another,
commanded by John Searles, had been screening
the heavy cruiser <i>Portland</i>, which had been badly
damaged in the previous night&rsquo;s battle and was
being towed to Tulagi.</p>
<p>Stilly Taylor tells what happened in one of the
most momentously important torpedo-boat adventures
of the Pacific War:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Japs began to shell Henderson Field, first
putting a very bright flare in the vicinity of the field,
and so naturally both of us [the two PTs] started
in on them independently....</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the Japs opened fire it was obvious to
us that there was at least one fairly heavy ship.
We thought it was probably a battleship.... We
could tell it was definitely a heavy ship because of
the long orange flash from its gunfire rather than the
short white flash which we knew from experience
was the smaller fire of the destroyers....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Due to the light put up by the Nip flares, I was
able to use my director for the first time. I set
the target&rsquo;s speed at about 20 knots, and I think he
was doing slightly more than this. I kept him in
the director for approximately seven of his salvos
and really had a beautiful line on him. [PT boats
usually were forced, by bad visibility at night and
in bad weather, to shoot from the hip. A chance to
use a director for visually aimed fire was an unaccustomed
luxury well worth gloating over in an
action report.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;After closing to about 1,000 yards, I decided
that if we went in any farther we would get
tangled up in the destroyer screen which I knew
would be surrounding him at about 500 to 700
yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I therefore fired three fish. The fourth misfired
and never left the tube. The three fish landed beautifully
and made no flash as we fired them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;We immediately turned around and started back
for the base, but we had the torpedoes running
hot and straight toward the target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am positive that at least one of them found
its mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Certainly the Nips ceased fire immediately and
apparently turned right around and limped home.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody knows what damage these two PTs
did that night. Planes the next day found a badly
damaged cruiser leaving the scene, and that could
well have been Taylor&rsquo;s victim. At any rate, the
material damage inflicted by these two brave seamen
and their crews is comparatively unimportant.</p>
<p>What is important is the almost incredible but
quite possible fact that the two cockleshells ran off
a horribly dangerous Japanese surface fleet prepared
to give Henderson Field what might well
have been its death blow. As soon as the torpedo
boats attacked, the Japanese stopped shooting and
ran.</p>
<p>It is not hard to understand why. The American
fleet had been badly battered during the previous
night&rsquo;s battle, but so had the Japanese fleet, and
Japanese nerves were probably raw and jumpy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The two PTs achieved complete surprise, and
a surprise attack in restricted waters is always unsettling
to naval officers, even the most cocksure
and well rested. The Japanese could not be sure exactly
who was attacking and in what force. They
could have had only a dim idea of what damage
they had done to the American Navy the night before,
and, for all they knew, the torpedo tracks they
saw came from a dangerous destroyer flotilla,
backed up by who knows how many mighty ships of
the line.</p>
<p>With their nerves shaken by the suddenness of the
torpedo attack and with no knowledge of what
was prowling around out there in the dark, it apparently
seemed best to the Japanese commanders
to abandon the bombardment quickly and save their
ships for another day.</p>
<p>The two glorified cabin cruisers had driven off
the Japanese task force when only three planes had
been destroyed and 17 damaged (all the damaged
planes were in the air before the end of the next
day), and Henderson Field was still in action. The
next day, November 14th, a smoothly functioning
Henderson Field was host not only to the Marine
planes permanently based there but also to Navy
planes from the carrier <i>Enterprise</i> which landed at
Henderson for refueling during shuttle trips to attack
11 fast Japanese transports coming down The
Slot.</p>
<p>All-day attacks on November 14th, by the Marine,
Navy, and Army planes, saved from destruction
by the two PT boats, sank seven of the transports
and worked a hideous massacre among the Japanese
soldiers on their decks and in their holds.
Four of the transports and 11 destroyers survived
and at sunset were sailing for the Japanese beach-head
of Tassafaronga Point. The destroyers carried
deckloads of survivors from the sunken transports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The destroyer commander was Rear Admiral
Raizo Tanaka, perhaps the most brilliant combat
officer of the Japanese navy. He repeatedly showed
a fantastic devotion to duty that enabled him to
carry out his missions in spite of seemingly impossible
difficulties. Tanaka <i>was</i> the Tokyo Express.</p>
<p>To give Tanaka a little help with the disembarkation
of the troops at Guadalcanal, the Japanese
planned to bombard Henderson during the landings
as a diversion&mdash;and just possibly as a <i>coup de
gr&acirc;ce</i> to further American air resistance. They sent
a battleship, two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers
and nine destroyers to do the job. This time the
light cruisers and destroyers were deployed in a
formidable anti-torpedo-boat screen to prevent a
recurrence of the previous night&rsquo;s spooking from a
measly two-boat PT raid.</p>
<p>The Japanese had lost their chance, however,
for much more American naval power than a brace
of torpedo boats stood between the Japanese and
Henderson Field. Admiral W. A. Lee, on the
battleship <i>Washington</i>, had arrived from the south,
accompanied by the battleship <i>South Dakota</i> and
four destroyers. He sailed north to meet the Japanese
across Iron Bottom Bay (so called because the
bottom was littered with the hulks of Japanese
and American ships sunk in earlier battles. There
were so many hulls on the ocean&rsquo;s floor that quartermasters
reported to their skippers that magnetic
compasses were deflected by the scrap iron).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The American admiral&mdash;known to his intimates
as &ldquo;Ching&rdquo; Lee&mdash;had a bad moment when he overheard
two PTs gossiping about his battleships over
the voice radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There go two big ones, but I don&rsquo;t know whose
they are,&rdquo; said one PT skipper.</p>
<p>Admiral Lee grabbed the microphone and quickly
identified himself to shore headquarters before the
PTs could get off a nervous shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refer your big boss about Ching Lee; Chinese,
catchee? Call off your boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PT skippers answered, with good humor,
that they were well acquainted with old &ldquo;Ching&rdquo;
and promised not to go after him.</p>
<p>The PT crews watched Admiral Lee sail into
the decisive last action of the three-day Battle of
Guadalcanal. That night his ships sank the Japanese
battleship and routed the Japanese bombardment
fleet. But the mixed transport and destroyer
reinforcement flotilla was taken, nevertheless, by
the stubborn and wily Admiral Tanaka, around the
action and to the beach at Tassafaronga where he
carried out his reinforcement mission almost literally
&ldquo;come hell or high water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The Japanese had made a mighty effort, but
American fliers, sailors, and PT boatmen had
spoiled the assault. The only profit to the Japanese
from the bloody three days was the landing of
2,000 badly shaken soldiers, 260 cases of ammunition,
and 1,500 bags of rice.</p>
<p>But the Japanese were not totally discouraged.
They had the redoubtable Tanaka on their side, and
so they went back to supply by the Tokyo Express.
The idea was for Tanaka&rsquo;s fast destroyers to run
down The Slot by night to Tassafaronga Point,
where sailors would push overboard drums of supplies.
Troops ashore would then round up the floating
drums in small boats. In that way, Tanaka&rsquo;s
fast destroyers would not have to stop moving and
would make a less tempting target for the Tulagi
PTs than a transport at anchor.</p>
<p class="tb">On November 30, 1942, Admiral Tanaka shoved
off from Bougainville Island with eight destroyers
loaded with 1,100 drums of supplies. At the
same moment an American task force of five cruisers
and six destroyers&mdash;a most formidable task
force indeed, especially for a night action&mdash;left
the American base at Espiritu Santo to break up just
the kind of supply run Tanaka was undertaking.</p>
<p>The two forces converged on Tassafaronga Point
from opposite directions. The American force
enormously outgunned Tanaka&rsquo;s destroyers and
also had the tremendous advantage of being, to
some extent, equipped with radar, then a brand-new
and little-understood gadget. Thus the American
force could expect to enjoy an additional superiority
of surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>And that is just the way it worked out. At 11:06
<span class="smaller">P.M.</span>, American radar picked up Tanaka&rsquo;s ships.
Admiral Tanaka&rsquo;s comparatively feeble flotilla was
blindly sailing into a trap.</p>
<p>American destroyers fired twenty torpedoes at
the still unsuspecting Japanese, who did not wake
up to their danger until the cruisers opened fire
with main battery guns at five-mile range.</p>
<p>The Japanese lashed back with a reflex almost as
automatic for Tanaka&rsquo;s well-drilled destroyer sailors
as jerking a finger back from a red-hot stove. They
instantly filled the water with torpedoes.</p>
<p>No American torpedoes scored. Six Japanese
torpedoes hit four American cruisers, sinking
<i>Northampton</i>, and damaging <i>Pensacola</i>, <i>Minneapolis</i>,
and <i>New Orleans</i> so seriously that they were
unfit for action for almost a year. Cruiser gunfire
sank one Japanese destroyer, but the rest of Admiral
Tanaka&rsquo;s ships, besides giving the vastly
superior American force a stunning defeat, even
managed to push overboard many of the drums
they had been sent down to deliver.</p>
<p>Tanaka had once more carried out his mission
and had won a great naval victory, almost as a
sideline to the main business.</p>
<p class="tb">On the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor, December
7, 1942, Admiral Tanaka came down again with
eleven destroyers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>This time it was not a mighty cruiser-destroyer
force waiting for him, but only eight PTs from
Tulagi. They were manned, however, by some of
the most aggressive officers and men in the American
Navy. The boats were deployed around Cape
Esperance and Savo Island, on the approaches to
Tassafaronga.</p>
<p>Two patrolling torpedo boats spotted Tanaka&rsquo;s
destroyers and attacked, but one broke down and
the other came to his rescue, so no shots were
fired. Nevertheless, the Admiral was spooked by
the abortive attack of two diminutive PTs, and retreated.
He recovered his courage in a few minutes
and tried again.</p>
<p>This time four PTs jumped him and fired twelve
torpedoes. When their tubes were empty, the PTs
roared by the destroyers, strafing with their machine
guns&mdash;and being strafed. Jack Searles, in
59, passed down the <i>Oyashio&rsquo;s</i> side less than a
hundred yards away, raking the destroyer&rsquo;s superstructure
and gun crews with 50-caliber fire. The
59 itself was also riddled, of course, but stayed
afloat.</p>
<p>Admiral Tanaka, who had run around the blazing
duel of battlewagons at the Battle of Guadalcanal
to deliver his reinforcements, who had bored
through massive day-long air attacks, who had gutted
a mighty cruiser force to deliver his cargo to
Tassafaronga, turned back before the threat of
four PTs, abandoned the mission, and fled back
to Bougainville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The PT navy at Tulagi (and the Marines and
soldiers on Guadalcanal) had good cause to celebrate
a clear-cut victory on this first anniversary
of Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p class="tb">Times were too hard for the PTs to get any rest.
Jack Searles patched up his bullet-torn 59, and,
with another boat, put out two nights later, on
December 9th, to machine-gun a Japanese landing
barge sighted near Cape Esperance. During the
barge-PT duel, one of Searles&rsquo; lookouts spotted a
submarine on the surface, oozing along at about
two knots. Jack whipped off two quick shots and
blew a 2,000-ton blockade-running submarine (I-3)
into very small pieces. There is no way to deny the
submarine to Jack Searles&rsquo; bag, because a Japanese
naval officer, the sole survivor, swam ashore and
told the story of the I-3&rsquo;s last moments.</p>
<p class="tb">On the night of December 11th Admiral Tanaka
began another run of the Tokyo Express with ten
destroyers. Dive bombers attacked during daylight,
but made no hits. The job of stopping Tanaka&rsquo;s
Tokyo Express was passed to the PTs. They
zipped out of the harbor at Tulagi and deployed
along the beach between Tassafaronga and Cape
Esperance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The night was bright and clear, and shortly after
midnight three PTs, commanded by Lieut. (jg)
Lester H. Gamble, saw the destroyer column and
attacked. The other two boats were skippered by
Stilly Taylor and Lieut. (jg) William E. Kreiner
III.</p>
<p>The Japanese destroyers turned on searchlights
and let go with main batteries and machine guns,
but the three torpedo boats got off their torpedoes
and popped two solid hits into the destroyer
<i>Teruzuki</i>. The Japanese ship blazed up, and for
the second time Tanaka had had enough of torpedo
boats. He went home.</p>
<p>The PTs had not yet had enough of Tanaka, however,
for Lieut. Frank Freeland&rsquo;s 44 heard the combat
talk of his squadron mates on the voice radio,
and came running. He roared past the burning
<i>Teruzuki</i>, chasing the retreating destroyers. Two
things were working against him; Lieut. Freeland
did not know it, but one of the destroyers had
stayed behind with the <i>Teruzuki</i>, and the flames
from the burning ship were lighting the PT boat
beautifully for the hidden Japanese gunners.</p>
<p>Aboard the 44 was Lieut. (jg) Charles M. Melhorn,
who reports his version of what happened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were throwing up quite a wake, and with
the burning cargo ship [he probably mistook the
burning <i>Teruzuki</i> for a cargo ship] lighting up the
whole area I thought we would soon be easy pickings
and I told the skipper so. Before he could
reply, Crowe, the quartermaster who was at the
wheel, pointed and yelled out &lsquo;Destroyer on the
starboard bow. There&rsquo;s your target, Captain.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Through the glasses I could make out a destroyer
two points on our starboard bow, distant
about 8,000 yards, course south-southwest. We came
right and started our run. We had no sooner
steadied on our new course than I picked up two
more destroyers through my glasses. They were in
column thirty degrees on our port bow, target
course 270, coming up fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skipper and I both saw at once that continuing
our present course would pin us against
the beach and lay us wide open to broadsides from
at least three Jap cans. The Skipper shifted targets
to the two destroyers, still about 4,000 yards
off, and we started in again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time we were directly between the
blazing ship and the two destroyers. As we started
the run I kept looking for the can that had fired....
I picked him up behind and to the left of our targets.
He was swinging, apparently to form up in
column astern of the other two. The trap was
sprung, and as I pointed out this fourth destroyer
the lead ship in the column opened fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 44 escaped from the destroyer ambush behind
a smoke screen, but once clear, turned about
for a second attack. The burning <i>Teruzuki</i> illuminated
the 44, and <i>Teruzuki&rsquo;s</i> guardian destroyer,
lurking in the dark, drew a bead on the ambushed
PT.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had just come out of our turn when we were
fired on.... I saw the blast, yelled &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for us.&rsquo;
and jumped down on the portside by the cockpit.
We were hit aft in the engine room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember much. For a few seconds
nothing registered at all. I looked back and saw a
gaping hole in what was once the engine-room
canopy. The perimeter of the hole was ringed by
little tongues of flame. I looked down into the water
and saw we had lost way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone on the bow said &lsquo;Shall we abandon
ship?&rsquo; Freeland gave the order to go ahead and
abandon ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed at the cockpit ... glancing over where
the shell came from. He let go again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dove ... I dove deep and was still under
when the salvo struck. The concussion jarred me
badly, but I kept swimming underwater. There was
a tremendous explosion, paralyzing me from the
waist down. The water around me went red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life jacket took control and pulled me to the
surface. I came up in a sea of fire, the flaming
embers of the boat cascading all about me. I tried
to get free of the life jacket but couldn&rsquo;t. I started
swimming feebly. I thought the game was up, but
the water which had shot sky high in the explosion
rained down and put out the fires around me....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;I took a few strokes away from the gasoline fire,
which was raging about fifteen yards behind me,
and as I turned back I saw two heads, one still
helmeted, between me and the flames. I called to
the two men and told them that I expected the
Japs to be over in short order to machine-gun us,
and to get their life jackets ready to slip. I told
them to get clear of the reflection of the fire as
quickly as possible, and proceeded to do so myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I struck out for Savo, whose skyline ridge I
could see dimly, and gradually made headway
toward shore. Every two or three minutes I
stopped to look back for other survivors or an approaching
destroyer, but saw nothing save the boat
which was burning steadily, and beyond it the
[<i>Teruzuki</i>] which burned and exploded all night
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime shortly before dawn a PT boat
cruised up and down off Savo and passed about
twenty-five yards ahead of me. I was all set to hail
him when I looked over my shoulder and saw a
Jap can bearing down on his starboard quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know whether the PT was maneuvering
to get a shot at him or not, so I kept my mouth
shut. I let him go by, slipped my life jacket, and
waited for the fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jap can lay motionless for some minutes,
and I finally made it out as nothing more than a
destroyer-shaped shadow formed by the fires and
smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge that I finally got ashore on Savo about
0730 or 0800. Lieutenant Stilly Taylor picked me
up off the beach about an hour later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Lieut. Melhorn was in the water between five
and six hours. Only one other sailor survived the explosion
of the 44&rsquo;s gas tank. Two officers and seven
enlisted men died.</p>
<p>Flames on the <i>Teruzuki</i>&mdash;the same flames that
lit the way to its fiery death for the 44&mdash;finally
ate their way into the depth-charge magazine, and
just before dawn the Japanese destroyer went up
with a jarring crash.</p>
<p>More important to the fighters on Guadalcanal
than the sinking of the <i>Teruzuki</i> was the astonishing
and gratifying fact that Admiral Tanaka, the destroyer
tiger, had been turned back one more time
by a handful of wooden cockleshells, without
landing his supplies. The big brass of the cruiser
fleet that had been unable to stop Tanaka at
the Battle of Tassafaronga must have been bewildered.</p>
<p class="tb">After the clash between Tanaka and the torpedo
boats on December 11th, no runs of the Tokyo Express
were attempted for three weeks. The long lull
meant dull duty for the PTs, but was a proof of
their effectiveness in derailing the Tokyo Express.
Japanese soldiers on Guadalcanal were down to
eating roots and leaves&mdash;and sometimes even
other Japanese, according to persistent reports
among the Japanese themselves&mdash;before their navy
worked up enough nerve to try another run of the
Tokyo Express.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>On January 2nd, ten destroyers came down The
Slot. One was damaged by a dive bomber&rsquo;s near
miss, and another was detached to escort the
cripple, but the other eight sailed on.</p>
<p>That night, eleven PTs attacked Tanaka&rsquo;s destroyers
with eighteen torpedoes, but had no luck.
Tanaka unloaded his drums and was gone before
dawn.</p>
<p>No matter. As soon as the sun came up, the PTs
puttered about Iron Bottom Bay, enjoying a bit of
target practice on the drums pushed off the destroyers&rsquo;
decks. One way or the other, the torpedo
boats of Tulagi snatched food from the mouths
of the starving Japanese garrison.</p>
<p>A week later a coast watcher up the line called
in word that Tanaka was running eight destroyers
down The Slot. Rouse out the PTs again!</p>
<p class="tb">Just after midnight on January 13th, Lieut. Rollin
Westholm, in PT 112, saw four destroyers and
called for a coordinated attack with Lieut. (jg)
Charles E. Tilden&rsquo;s 43.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em good,&rdquo; Lieut. Westholm said, so Lieut.
Tilden took his 43 into 400-yard range before
firing two. Both missed. To add to his disastrous
bad luck, the port tube flashed a bright red light, a
blazing giveaway of the 43&rsquo;s position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The destroyer hit the 43 with the second salvo,
and all hands went over the side, diving deep to
escape machine-gun strafing. The destroyer passed
close enough so that the swimming sailors could
hear the Japanese chattering on the deck.</p>
<p>Lieut. Clark W. Faulkner, in 40, drew a bead
on the second destroyer in column and fired four.
His heart was made glad by what he thought was a
juicy hit, so he took his empty tubes back home.</p>
<p>Lieut. Westholm, in 112, took on the third destroyer
and was equally certain he had put one into
his target, but two of the destroyers had zeroed in
during his approach run, and two shells blew his
boat open at the waterline. Lieut. Westholm
and his eleven shipmates watched the rest of the
battle from a life raft. The other PTs fired twelve
fish, but didn&rsquo;t even claim any hits.</p>
<p>Either Lieut. Westholm or Lieut. Faulkner had
scored, however, for the <i>Hatsukaze</i> had caught a
torpedo under the wardroom. The Japanese skipper
at first despaired of saving his ship, but damage-control
parties plugged the hole well enough
so that he was able to escape before daylight.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, the PTs still afloat picked up
survivors of the two lost torpedo boats and then
went through the morning routine of sinking the
250 floating drums of supplies the destroyers had
jettisoned. The starving Japanese watching from the
beach must have wished all torpedo boats in hell
that morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The Japanese did come out to tow in the wreckage
of the PT 43, but a New Zealand warship
stepped in with a few well-placed broadsides and
reduced the already splintered torpedo boat to
a mess of matchwood before the Japanese could
study it.</p>
<p class="tb">Nobody but the Japanese High Command knew
it at this point, but the plane and PT blockade of
the Tokyo Express had won; the island garrison
had been starved out.</p>
<p>During the night between February 1st and 2nd,
coast watchers reported 20 Japanese destroyers
coming down The Slot. The American Navy had
no way of knowing it, but the Tokyo Express was
running in reverse. The decks of those destroyers
were clear&mdash;they were being kept clear to make
room for a deckload of the starved-out Japanese
on Guadalcanal. Japan was finally calling it quits
and pulling out of the island.</p>
<p>Whatever the mission of the Japanese ships, the
mission of the American Navy was clear&mdash;to keep
the Japanese from doing whatever it was they
were doing and to sink some ships in the process.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Three American mine-layers sprinkled 300 mines
north of Guadalcanal, near Savo Island, in the
waters where the destroyers might be expected
to pass. Eleven PTs waiting in ambush attacked
the destroyers as they steamed by the minefield.
The PTs rejoiced at a good, solid hit on a destroyer
by somebody&mdash;nobody was sure whom&mdash;and
the destroyer <i>Makigumo</i> admittedly acquired
an enormous hole in the hull at that very moment,
but the Japanese skipper said that he hit a mine.
He said he never saw any PTs attacking him.</p>
<p>Postwar assessment officers say that he probably
hit a mine while maneuvering to avoid a PT
torpedo. Avoid a torpedo attack he never even
saw? Someone is confused. Some of the PT sailors
who were sure of hits on the <i>Makigumo</i> have a
tendency to get sulky when this minefield business
is mentioned, and nobody can blame them. The
<i>Makigumo</i>, at any rate, had to be scuttled.</p>
<p>Regardless of what damage they did to the Japanese,
the PTs themselves suffered terribly in this
battle.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) J. H. Claggett&rsquo;s 111 was hit by a shell
and set afire. The crew swam until morning, fighting
off sharks and holding up the wounded. Two
torpedo boatmen were killed.</p>
<p>Ensign James J. Kelly&rsquo;s 37 caught a shell on the
gas tank and disappeared in a puff of orange
flame. One badly wounded man survived.</p>
<p>Ensign Ralph L. Richards&rsquo; 123 had stalked to
within 500 yards of a destroyer target when a Japanese
glide bomber slid in from nowhere, dropped
a single bomb, and made possibly the most fantastically
lucky hit of the war. The bomb landed
square on the tiny fantail of the racing PT boat. The
boat went up in a blur of flames and splinters.
Four men were killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>In spite of the fierce attacks of the PT flotilla,
Tanaka&rsquo;s sailors managed to take the destroyers in
to the beach, load a shipment of evacuees, and slip
out again for the quick run home.</p>
<p class="tb">This was the last and by far the bloodiest action
of the PTs in the Guadalcanal campaign. The PTs
had lost three boats and seventeen men in the battle
and had not scored themselves&mdash;unless you
count the destroyer <i>Makigumo</i>, which PT sailors
stubbornly insist is theirs.</p>
<p>An over-all summary of their contribution to the
campaign for Guadalcanal, however, gives them a
whopping score:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A submarine and a destroyer sunk [not counting
<i>Makigumo</i>]</p>
<p>Two destroyers badly damaged</p>
<p>Tons of Japanese supply drums riddled and
sunk</p>
<p>Dozens of disaster victims pulled from the
water</p>
<p>Two massive bombardments just possibly
scared off</p>
<p>And&mdash;by far the most important credit&mdash;the
Tokyo Express of Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka ambushed
and definitely turned back twice after a
powerful cruiser force had failed at the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Even after the postwar assessment teams cut
down PT sinking credits to a fraction of PT claims,
there is still plenty of credit left for a force ten
times the size of the Tulagi fleet.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1942, as the Japanese defense
of Guadalcanal was crumbling, American forces
began to inch forward elsewhere in the Pacific, most
notably on the island of New Guinea, almost 600
miles to the west of Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>New Guinea is the second largest island in the
world (only Greenland is larger). Dropped over
the United States, the island would reach from
New York City to Houston, Texas; it is big
enough to cover all of New England, plus New
York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio,
Kentucky, and all of Tennessee, except for Memphis
and its suburbs. Even today, vast inland areas
are unexplored and possibly some tribes in the
mountains have never even heard about the white
man&mdash;or about the Japanese either, for that matter.
The island is shaped like a turkey, with its head
and wattles pointed east.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Early in the war, right after the fall of the
Philippines and of the East Indies, the Japanese
had landed on the turkey&rsquo;s back. The Australians
held the turkey&rsquo;s belly. The Japanese had tried to
cross the grim Owen Stanley Mountains, to get at
the turkey&rsquo;s underside, but tough Australian troops
had slugged it out with them and pushed them
back. The fight in the mountains was so miserable
for both sides that everybody had tacitly agreed
that the battle for New Guinea would be decided
along the beaches.</p>
<p>Splitting the very tip of the turkey&rsquo;s tail is Milne
Bay, a magnificent anchorage. Whoever held Milne
Bay could prevent the other side from spreading
farther along the coast. Australians and Americans,
under the command of General MacArthur, moved
first, seized Milne Bay in June of 1942, and successfully
fought off a Japanese landing force.</p>
<p>A curious example of the misery the homefolks
can deal out to front-line fighters is the mix-up
caused by the code name for Milne Bay. For some
obscure reason, the Gili Gili base, at Milne Bay,
was called &ldquo;Fall River.&rdquo; Naturally, according to the
inexorable workings of Murphy&rsquo;s Law (if anything
<i>can</i> go wrong, it <i>will</i>) many of the supplies for
Milne Bay were delivered to bewildered supply
officers at Fall River, Massachusetts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Despite this foul-up, by the end of October, 1942,
Milne Bay was safely in the hands of the Allies and
ready to support an advance along the bird&rsquo;s
back. All movement had to be by sea, for there
were no roads through New Guinea&rsquo;s jungles, and
the waters around the turkey&rsquo;s tail were the most
poorly charted in the world. Navigators of deep-draft
ships were horrified to have to sail through
reef- and rock-filled waters, depending on charts
with disquieting notes like &ldquo;Reef possibly seen
here by Entrecasteaux in 1791.&rdquo; No naval commander
in his right mind would commit deep-draft
ships to such uncharted and dangerous waters
for nighttime duty. Which means that the times
and the coastal waters of eastern New Guinea
were made for PT boats, or vice versa.</p>
<p>On December 17, 1942, less than a week after
the PTs of Tulagi had fought the last big battle
with the <i>incoming</i> Tokyo Express, the PT tender
<i>Hilo</i> towed two torpedo boats into Milne Bay
and set up for business. Other PTs followed. For
seven more months motor torpedo boats were to
be the entire surface striking force of the U. S.
Navy in the Solomon Sea around the tail of the
New Guinea turkey.</p>
<p>By the time the <i>Hilo</i> had arrived at Milne Bay,
the fight for the turkey&rsquo;s back had moved 200 miles
up the coast to a trio of villages called Buna, Gona,
and Sanananda. Two hundred miles is too long a
haul for PT boats, so the <i>Hilo</i> stayed at Milne Bay
as a kind of rear base, the main striking force of
PTs moving closer to the fighting. They set up
camp at Tufi, in the jungles around Oro Bay, almost
within sight of the Buna battlefield, and began the
nightly coastal patrols that were to stretch on for
almost two weary years before all of New Guinea
was back in Allied hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>First blood was drawn on Christmas Eve. Ensign
Robert F. Lynch celebrated the holiday by
taking out the PT 122 for a routine patrol, looking
for small Japanese coasters or submarines running
supplies and reinforcements into Buna. The night
was dark and rainy, and the PT chugged along
without much hope of finding any action. PTs had
no radar in those days, and a visual lookout was
not very effective in a New Guinea downpour.</p>
<p>Even in New Guinea, however, the rain cannot go
on forever. When the rain clouds parted, a bright
moon lit up the sea and a lookout snapped to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Submarine,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Dead ahead, a submarine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hove to on the surface was a Japanese I-boat,
probably waiting for Japanese small craft to come
from the beach for supplies, or else recharging its
batteries, or probably both. Ensign Lynch began his
silent stalk and closed to 1,000 yards without alarming
the submarine&rsquo;s crew. He fired two torpedoes
and kept on closing the range to 500 yards, where
he fired two more. The submarine went up in a geyser
of water, scrap iron, and flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Ensign Lynch thought he saw a dim shape beyond
his victim and was alert when another surfaced
I-boat shot four torpedoes at him. He slipped
between the torpedo tracks, but could do nothing
about retaliating, because he had emptied his tubes.
He had to let the second I-boat go. Postwar assessment
gives Ensign Lynch a definite kill on this
submarine.</p>
<p>The same Christmas Eve, two other PTs from
the Oro Bay base sank two barges full of troops.</p>
<p>Ensign Lynch&rsquo;s torpedoing of the submarine&mdash;the
first combat victory of the PT fleet in New
Guinea waters&mdash;was a spectacular triumph, but
the sinking of two barges was much more typical
of the action to come.</p>
<p>The terrible attrition of ships in the Guadalcanal
fight had left the Japanese short of sea transport.
Besides, Allied airmen made the sea approaches to
New Guinea a dangerous place for surface craft
in daylight. Nevertheless, the Japanese had to find
some way to supply their New Guinea beachheads
by sea or give them up, so they began a crash program
of barge construction.</p>
<p>The barges were of many types, but the most
formidable was the <i>daihatsu</i>, a steel or wooden
barge, diesel powered, armored, heavily armed
with machine guns or even with automatic light
cannon. They could not be torpedoed, because their
draft was so shallow that a torpedo would pass
harmlessly under their hulls. They could soak up
enormous amounts of machine-gun fire and could
strike back with their own automatic weapons
and the weapons of soldier passengers. A single
<i>daihatsu</i> could be a dangerous target for a PT. A
fleet of <i>daihatsus</i>, giving each other mutual fire support,
could well be too much to handle even for a
brace of coordinated PTs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The naval war around New Guinea became a
nightly brawl between <i>daihatsu</i> and PT, and the
torpedo function of the PT shriveled. Eventually
many of the boats abandoned their torpedo tubes
entirely and placed them with 37-mm. and 40-mm.
cannon and extra 50-caliber machine guns, fine
weapons for punching through a <i>daihatsu&rsquo;s</i> armor.
The PT in New Guinea gradually changed its main
armament from the torpedo&mdash;a sledge-hammer
type of weapon for battering heavy warships&mdash;to
the multiple autocannon&mdash;a buzz-saw type of
weapon for slicing up small craft.</p>
<p class="tb">At the Buna-Gona-Sanananda battlefield, the Japanese
were dying of starvation. It was the story of
Guadalcanal again&mdash;with supply from the sea cut
off by aggressive American patrols, the emperor&rsquo;s
infantry&mdash;no matter how desperately brave&mdash;could
not stand up to a long campaign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The night between January 17th and 18th, the
<i>Roaring Twenty</i> (PT 120) caught three barges trying
to slip out of Sanananda. The PT recklessly took
on all three in a machine-gun duel, sank two of
them, and set the third afire. PT sailors were the
first to know that the end had come for the Japanese
ashore, because the barges were loaded with
Japanese officers trying to slip away from their
doomed men. Next day Sanananda fell to the Australians.</p>
<p class="tb">When both the base at Sanananda, on the turkey&rsquo;s
tail, and Guadalcanal fell to the Allies in the first
months of 1943, the Japanese tried to slam an
impenetrable gate across the path of the Allied
advance. The eastern hinge of the gate was to be
the mighty naval base and airfield complex at
Rabaul, on the island of New Britain. The western
hinge was planned for the place where the turkey&rsquo;s
tail joins the turkey&rsquo;s back, an indentation of the
New Guinea coastline called Huon Gulf.</p>
<p>To build up the western hinge of the gate, the
Japanese landed at the ports of Lae, Salamaua, and
Finschhafen, on the Huon Gulf. The Japanese
wanted Huon Gulf so badly that they even dared
send a fleet of surface transports to ferry 6,900 reinforcements
across the Bismarck Sea to New Guinea.
The convoy run was daring, because it would be
within reach of land-based Allied bombers almost
the whole way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Escorting the eight transports were eight destroyers,
veterans of the Tokyo Express. Tanaka,
however, was no longer with them. He had been
relieved of his command for telling the high
navy brass in Tokyo some unpleasant truths. He
spent the rest of the war on the beach as a penalty
for speaking up about mistakes made at Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>The Japanese convoy sailed from Rabaul, at
the eastern hinge of the gate, on March 1st, under
cover of a terrible storm which the ships&rsquo; captains
hoped would ground Allied bombers. On March 3rd
the storm lifted unexpectedly. The seasick soldiers
felt slightly less miserable.</p>
<p>In Japan March 3rd is Doll&rsquo;s Day, a sentimental
family holiday when little Japanese girls dress
up their dolls and parade them about the streets
under the fond eyes of admiring fathers. Many of
the soldiers were depressed at being on such a
martial mission on Doll&rsquo;s Day, so their officers
passed out candy as a little touch of holiday. The
officers did not tell the soldiers that the lifting of the
storm had been a disaster, that an Allied snooper
had already spotted the convoy, and that Allied
bombers were almost surely on the way.</p>
<p>Worse was on the way than ordinary bombers.</p>
<p>Back in Australia, the American bomber force
had been working on a new dirty trick, and
bomber pilots were eager to try it on the transports
crowded with candy-munching soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Mechanics had torn out all the bombardier equipment
from the nose of B 25 attack bombers and had
mounted eight 50-caliber machine guns. Under
each B 25 they had slung two 500-pound bombs
armed with five-second delay fuses. The idea was
to make a low-level bombing run, so as to skip
the bombs across the water like flat stones. The delayed-action
fuses were to keep the bombs from detonating
until they had slammed into the ships&rsquo;
sides. When the snooper reported the convoy, it
sounded to Allied bomber pilots like the perfect
target for testing the new weapon.</p>
<p>While fighters and high-level bombers kept the
Japanese convoy occupied, the converted B 25s
came at the Japanese so low that the blast of their
propellers churned the sea. The Japanese skippers
thought they were torpedo bombers&mdash;which
they were, in a sense&mdash;and turned into the attack,
to present the narrowest possible target, a wise
maneuver ordinarily, but this also made the
ships the best possible targets for the long, thin
pattern of the machine-gun ripsaws mounted in
the bombers&rsquo; noses. The ships were ripped from
stem to gudgeon by the strafing runs. Then, when
the pilots were sure the antiaircraft gun crews had
been sawed to shreds, the low-flying B 25s charged
at the ships broadside and released the skip
bombs, which caved in hull plates at the waterlines
and let in fatal doses of sea water. It was almost
impossible to miss with a skip bomb. By nightfall
the Bismarck Sea was dotted with rafts, lifeboats,
and swimmers clinging to the debris of
sunken ships. Only darkness stopped the slaughter
from the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>After that sunset, however, the slaughter from
the sea became more grisly than ever. Eight PTs
from New Guinea, under Lieut. Commander Barry
K. Atkins, fought their way to the battle zone
through the heavy seas in the wake of the storm
which had so treacherously deserted the Japanese
convoy.</p>
<p>Just before midnight they spotted the burning
transport <i>Oigawa Maru</i>. PT 143 and PT 150 each
fired a torpedo and blew the transport out of
the water. The PT sailors searched all night but
could find no other targets&mdash;largely because almost
all of them were already on the floor of
the Bismarck Sea.</p>
<p>When the sun came up they had targets enough,
but of a most distasteful kind. The sea was swarming
with Japanese survivors, and it was the unhappy
duty of the PTs to try to kill them to the
last man, so that they could not get ashore on
nearby New Guinea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>On March 5th the same two PTs that had sunk
the <i>Oigawa Maru</i> jumped a Japanese submarine
picking up survivors from three boats. The PTs
charged, firing torpedoes, but they missed the
crash-diving submarine. Then they were presented
with the hideous problem of what to do with the
100 helpless soldiers who watched fearfully from
the three boats. The Japanese would not surrender,
and they could not be allowed to escape.</p>
<p>The two PTs turned on the machine guns and set
about the grim butchery of the unhappy Japanese.
When the execution was over, they sank the
three blood-drenched boats with a shallow pattern
of depth charges.</p>
<p>Scout planes conned other PTs to lifeboats and
rafts crammed with Japanese. More than 3,000
soldiers died, but so thick were the survivors that
several hundred managed to swim ashore despite
the best vigilance of the small-craft navy.
The natives of New Guinea, who had long chafed
against the Australian law forbidding head-hunting,
were unleashed by the authorities and had a field
day tracking down the few Japanese who made
it to the beach.</p>
<p>Eighteen Japanese made an astonishing 400-mile
voyage through PT-patrolled waters to a tiny island
in the Trobriand group. They were captured
by the crew of PT 114 in a pioneer landing party
operation of the PT fleet.</p>
<p>The skip bombers of the American Air Force had
sunk four destroyers and eight transports, killed
3,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors, and shot down
30 planes. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea was a
smashing blow to the Japanese, and they never
again risked a surface transport near eastern New
Guinea (except for a one-night run of four destroyers
in a feeble and abortive attempt to set up a
spurline of the Tokyo Express.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p class="tb">The American Navy had an official torpedo-boat
doctrine, of course, and PT officers were well
drilled in the proper manner of delivering torpedoes
in combat before they left the States, but
this night-prowling business against torpedo-proof
barges called for new torpedo-boat tactics.</p>
<p>Lieuts. (jg) Skipper Dean in PT 114, and Francis
H. McAdoo, Jr., in PT 129, tried the still-hunt
methods of Mississippi, where sportsmen hide
themselves beside a known game trail and let
the stag walk right up to his death. On the night
between March 15th and 16th, the two PTs set up
an ambush in a known barge rendezvous. They
slipped into Mai-Ama Bay, a tiny inlet on the
Huon Gulf shoreline, which they suspected was a
Japanese barge terminal, and there they cut their
engines and waited. As usual, it was raining and
visibility was virtually zero.</p>
<p>The current persisted in setting the boats toward
the gulf, so the 114 dropped anchor. Lieut.
McAdoo found that he was too restless for a still
hunt, so he oozed the 129 back into the gulf on one
engine, to see if any barges were unloading south
of the entrance to the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The PT sailors didn&rsquo;t know it, but six Japanese
barges had arrived before them and were unloading
all around in the darkness. Two of the
drifting barges, already unloaded and idling about
the bay until time to form up for the return
trip, bumped into the side of the 114. To the
PT sailors it was as though a clammy hand had
touched them in a haunted house. They were galvanized.</p>
<p>Silence and stealth were second nature to them,
however, so they moved quietly to battle stations.
The Japanese on the barges, happily assuming that
the PT was another Japanese ship, chattered amiably
among themselves.</p>
<p>Machine-gunners on the PT strained to depress
their 50-caliber mounts, but the barges were too
close. Sailors quietly cocked submachine guns instead.</p>
<p>At the skipper&rsquo;s signal, with blazing Tommy
guns, the crew hosed down the decks of the two
<i>daihatsus</i> that were holding the PT in their
embarrassingly close embrace. The PT anchor was
snagged to the bottom, so a sailor parted the
line with an ax, and the PT tried to put a little
distance between itself and the Japanese.</p>
<p>The aft 50 calibers sank one barge, but the other
caught under the bow of the PT and plugged its
escape route. Skipper Dean solved the problem
by shoving the throttles up to the stops and riding
over the barge, which swamped and sank under
the PT&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The 114, once free from the two <i>daihatsus</i>,
turned back into the inlet with guns roaring. The
129 came running, and the two PTs mopped up the
rest of the six-barge convoy.</p>
<p class="tb">The Australian army had taken on the job of
throwing the Japanese out of the three Huon
Gulf villages that formed the western hinge of the
Japanese gate. They were doing as well as could be
expected with the nasty job of fighting in the
filthy jungles of New Guinea, but they were
having supply problems almost as serious as
those of the blockaded Japanese. The Allies had
no beachhead near the Australians, and supplies, in
miserly quantities, had to be flown to a jungle airstrip
and packed to the troops by native bearers.</p>
<p>The PT fleet in New Guinea had become
so sophisticated by this time that it had
acquired a formal organization and an over-all commander,
a former submarine skipper named Morton
Mumma. Aboard one of his PTs, Commander
Mumma had gone poking about the little-known
shoreline around the Huon Gulf (Mort Bay was
named for him, because he first explored it), and
he had found a fine landing beach at Nassau Bay.
The beach was right under the nose of the Japanese
garrison at Salamaua, it&rsquo;s true, but it was also
temptingly handy to the Australian lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>On the last day of June, 1943, three PTs packed
a company of riflemen on their deck. With 36
small Army landing boats, the PTs sortied into a
foul sea, lashed by high winds and rain. Total
naval escort for the amphibious armada was PT
168, which presumably was in better fighting trim
than the others, because it carried no seasick passengers.
PT 168 promptly lost its convoy in the
storm.</p>
<p><i>The Flying Shamrock</i> (PT 142) missed the
landing beach at Nassau Bay and did a countermarch.
In the rain and darkness, the <i>Shamrock</i>
beat the astronomical odds against such an accident
by ramming the tiny PT 143, to the alarm of
the miserable foot soldiers on both boats.</p>
<p>The Army landing craft scattered in the storm,
and the two PTs had to round them up and
guide them to the beach, where several broached in
the high surf and were abandoned. Short of landing
craft to put their own sea-weary passengers
ashore, the PTs had to carry them back to the
staging area.</p>
<p>Despite the less than 100 per cent efficiency of
the operation, the few American soldiers who
had reached the beach threw the Japanese garrison
into a panic. A lucky bomb hit had killed their
able commander, and without his support the 300
Japanese assigned to guard Nassau Bay broke and
fled before the insignificant Allied invasion force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Puny as they were, the landings at Nassau Bay
threw the Japanese high command into a flap.
They saw clearly, possibly even more clearly
than the Allies, that the Nassau Bay beachhead was
going to unhinge the whole Japanese gate across
the Allied path. The landings also paid an unexpected
bonus far to the east, where American soldiers
were landing on Rendova Island, as part
of the island-hopping advance up the central Solomons
toward the eastern hinge of the Japanese
gate. The Japanese at Rabaul were so alarmed by
the minuscule PT operation at Nassau Bay that
they jammed their own radio circuits with alarms
and outcries. The Japanese at Rendova couldn&rsquo;t
get anybody to listen to their anguished cries for
help, and the American troops went ashore with
almost no air opposition.</p>
<p>Ashore on Huon Gulf, the Australians still had
the uncomfortable job of convincing the stubborn
Japanese foot soldiers that they were doomed, and
previously the only way to convince them had
been to kill them by bullets or starvation. The PTs
tightened the blockade by night.</p>
<p>Just before the end at Finschhafen, when the
Japanese were getting ready to give up the Huon
Gulf, barge traffic increased. It was the same
story as the earlier abandonment of Buna, Gona,
and Sanananda. The Japanese were slipping out
by night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>On the night between August 28th and 29th, two
PTs patrolled off Finschhafen. Ensign Herbert P.
Knight was skipper of the 152; Lieut. (jg) John
L. Carey was skipper of <i>The Flying Shamrock</i>
(PT 142). Riding the <i>Shamrock</i>, in command of
the operation, was a most distinguished PT sailor,
Lieut. John Bulkeley, rescuer of MacArthur, back
from his tour in the United States as the number
one naval hero of the Philippines campaign.</p>
<p>Lookouts spotted three barges, and one went
down under the first attack by the two PT boats,
but the other two were still afloat after the third
firing run. Ensign Knight dropped depth charges
alongside, but the barges rode out the blast and
were still afloat when the geysers of sea water
settled. Lieut. Carey made a depth-charge run and
blew one of the barges apart, but the other still
survived.</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Shamrock</i>, Bulkeley decided to finish
the job in the old-fashioned way&mdash;by hand.</p>
<p>For the first time in this century, with a cry
of &ldquo;Boarders away,&rdquo; a U. S. Navy boarding party,
weapons in hand, swarmed aboard an enemy craft.
One Japanese made a move in the darkness, and
Lieut. Bulkeley blew him down with a 45 automatic.
The other passengers, twelve fully equipped
soldiers, were already dead.</p>
<p>The boarders picked up what documents and
equipment they thought would be interesting to Intelligence,
and reboarded their PT. The 152
pumped 37-mm shells into the barge until it slid
under the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Ashore, Intelligence captured the diary of a Japanese
officer named Kobayashi. Under the date of
August 29, 1943, was the entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last night with the utmost precaution we
were without incident transported safely by
barge between Sio and Finschhafen. <i>So far,
there has not been a time during such trips
when barges have not been attacked by enemy
torpedo boats.</i> However, it was reported that
the barge unit which transported us was attacked
and sunk on the return trip last night
and the barge commander and his men were
all lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PT blockade at sea and the Australian
drive ashore pinched the Japanese hard, and on
September 16th Australian infantrymen walked into
a deserted Finschhafen. The western hinge of the
gate had been broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">4.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Battering Down the Gate:</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">the Eastern Hinge</span></h2>
<p>The western end of the Japanese gate was
nailed to the great land mass of New Guinea,
and its unhinging was a natural job for the Army.
The eastern hinge was at Rabaul, in the tangle of
islands and reef-strewn sea channels that make up
the Solomon and Bismarck archipelagos. Reduction
of Rabaul was naturally a Navy job, to be carried
on simultaneously with the Army effort in New
Guinea.</p>
<p>After the fall of Guadalcanal in February, 1943,
the master plan in the South Pacific, under Admiral
William Halsey, was to hop from island to island
through the central Solomons, reducing one by one
the Japanese bases arranged like steppingstones
between Guadalcanal and Rabaul.</p>
<p>PTs were moved up as fast as new bases were
established, because they were short of range and
useless if they fell too far behind the front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The night the Army went ashore at Rendova
(June 30, 1943), three PTs sailed up Blanche Channel,
on the approaches to the Rendova landing
beach. Coming down the same channel was the
American landing flotilla, transports, supply ships,
and escorting destroyers. The destroyer <i>McCawley</i>,
damaged by one of the few Japanese air attacks
that opposed the Rendova landings, was
being towed to Tulagi, but was riding lower and
lower in the water and its survival was doubtful.
Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner (riding <i>McCawley</i>
as flagship of the Rendova invasion force)
was debating whether or not to give the stricken
ship euthanasia by friendly torpedo when his mind
was made up for him by two mysterious fish
which came out of the night and blew <i>McCawley</i>
out of the water.</p>
<p>The deadly PTs had struck again! But, alas,
under the illusion that they were hitting an enemy
transport. Explanation of the snafu? The usual
lack of communications between PTs and other
commands. The PTs had been told there would
be no friendlies in Blanche Channel that night&mdash;and
the only friendlies they encountered just happened
to be the entire Rendova landing fleet.</p>
<p class="tb">American soldiers quickly captured Rendova
Island, and the PT navy set up a base there.
Across Blanche Channel, on New Georgia Island,
Marines and soldiers were fighting a heartbreaking
jungle action to capture the Japanese airfield
at Munda, but they had taken over enough of New
Georgia for another PT base on The Slot side of the
island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Business was slow at first for the PTs. The big-ship
admirals, who were fighting repeated destroyer-cruiser
night actions in those waters&mdash;and
who were possibly nervous about the PTs since the
<i>McCawley</i> incident&mdash;ordered the PTs to stay in
when the big ships went out.</p>
<p>Concern of the admirals over poor communications
between PTs and other units was justified.
Early on the morning of July 20th, three
torpedo boats were returning to Rendova Base
through Fergusson Passage. Three B 25s&mdash;the same
kind of aircraft that had performed such terrible
execution of the Japanese in the Bismarck Sea&mdash;spotted
the patrol craft and came down to
the deck for a strafing run.</p>
<p>Aboard PT 168, Lieut. Edward Macauley III
held his gunners in tight check while they suffered
under the murderous fire of the friendly planes.
Repeatedly the gunners of the 168 held their
breath as the B 25s raked them with bullets&mdash;but
they held their own fire in a superb display of
discipline. Not so the other two boats. Gunners
were unable to stand being shot at without shooting
back, and the first PT burst of counterfire brought
down a bomber in flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Somehow the other bombers came to their senses
and the strafing runs stopped, but all the boats had
already been riddled and two were burning. The
166 was past saving. Sound crew members helped
the wounded over the side into life rafts and paddled
frantically away from the burning craft.
They made it out of danger just as the gas tanks
went up in a blast of searing orange flame.</p>
<p>Lieut. Macauley and his brave crew&mdash;the only
group to come out of the ghastly affair with unblemished
credit&mdash;took their still burning 168
alongside the stricken bomber to rescue survivors
before the plane went down. Three of the bomber
crew were dead; the three survivors were
wounded. One bomber and one PT were lost in
the sad affair. One officer and ten men of the
torpedo-boat patrol were wounded.</p>
<p>Reason for the tragic mistake? Same as for the
<i>McCawley</i> sinking. The bomber pilots had been
told that there would be no friendly vessels in
those waters at that time.</p>
<p class="tb">PTs were harassed, during the night patrols, by
Japanese seaplanes escorting the Japanese barge
convoys, so one PT skipper and a night fighter plane
rigged an ambush. An American night fighter was
to perch aloft, the PT was to charge about, throwing
up a glittering rooster&rsquo;s tail of a wake to attract
a float plane, and the night fighter was to
jump on the float plane&rsquo;s back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The plan worked like a fifty-dollar clock. The
noisy, rambunctious PT lured down a float plane&mdash;OK
so far&mdash;and the PT&rsquo;s skipper conned the
escorting night fighter in to the counterattack.</p>
<p>The first word from the night fighter, however,
was a disconcerting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being attacked by the
float plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him down to two feet,&rdquo; said the PT
skipper, &ldquo;and <i>we&rsquo;ll</i> get on his tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody was hurt.</p>
<p class="tb">PTs fought some lively barge actions on July 23rd
and 27th, but the big battle&mdash;the naval battle which
has earned what is surely the most exaggerated
fame of all time for its importance&mdash;the battle of
the 109, took place the night between August 1st
and 2nd.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 1st, search planes
saw four Japanese destroyers coming down The
Slot. They were loaded with 900 soldiers and supplies
for the embattled defenders of the Munda airfield.
It was a typical run of the Tokyo Express
and a prime target for PTs.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, when the Japanese destroyers
were still far from Rendova, the Japanese
showed their deep respect for motor torpedo
boats by socking the Rendova base with bombs
from 25 planes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Two PTs were sunk by a bomber which crashed
into their nest. One of the PTs destroyed was
164, which had survived the tragic strafing by
B25s just eleven days before.</p>
<p class="tb">At sunset 15 PTs&mdash;four of them equipped with
the new-fangled gadget called radar&mdash;sortied
from the base under the command of Lieut. Henry
I. Brantingham aboard 159. Brantingham was another
veteran of the MacArthur rescue run in the
Philippines. The PTs were deployed around the
approaches to the Japanese landing beach for resupplying
Munda airfield.</p>
<p>Lieut. Brantingham, naturally, had chosen a radar-equipped
boat for his flagship, and so was the
first to pick up the Tokyo Express, just after midnight
on August 2nd. Brantingham, for some reason,
thought his radar pips were from landing craft,
and closed for a strafing run, but 4.7-inch shells
from the destroyers persuaded him that his targets
were fair torpedo game. He and Lieut. (jg)
William F. Liebnow, Jr., in 157, fired six torpedoes.
No hits. The two boats escaped behind puffs
of smoke.</p>
<p>Worse than the six misses was the lack of communication.
The other PTs, most of them without
radar, didn&rsquo;t even know the destroyers had
arrived on the scene, much less that they had been
alerted by the torpedo runs of 157 and 159.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Next to pick up the cans was the radar-equipped
171, carrying the division commander,
Lieut. Arthur H. Berndtson. The boat&rsquo;s skipper,
Ensign William Cullen Battle, closed at a slinking
ten knots to 1,500 yards, where Lieut. Berndtson
fired a full salvo of fish. All four tubes blazed up in
a grease fire that was as helpful to the destroyer
gunners as a spotlighted bull&rsquo;s-eye. Shellbursts
splashed water aboard the 171 as the boat ripped
out to sea.</p>
<p>Again the attacking PT which had missed its
target failed to report by radio to the other PT
skippers, who were straining their eyes in the
darkness looking for ships they didn&rsquo;t know were
already on the scene.</p>
<p>A third radar boat, Lieut. George E. Cookman&rsquo;s
107, picked up the cans on the radar set and
missed with four fish. Three other PTs, aroused
by the flash of destroyer gunfire, came running from
the southeast. A Japanese float plane strafed them,
and destroyer salvos straddled the boats, but they
got off all their torpedoes&mdash;12 of them&mdash;and all
12 missed.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Express went through the strait and
unloaded 900 soldiers and supplies.</p>
<p>So bad were communications between the PTs
that most of the 15 skippers who had started the
patrol still didn&rsquo;t know that the destroyers had
arrived and been unsuccessfully attacked, much
less that they had already discharged their cargoes
and were going home. And that meant the destroyers
were coming up on the PT lookouts from behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>At the wheel of the 109 was Lieut. John F.
Kennedy. The boat was idling along on one engine
to save fuel and to cruise as silently as possible&mdash;good
PT doctrine for night patrol.</p>
<p>A lookout on the destroyer <i>Amagiri</i> saw the 109
at about the same instant a lookout on the PT saw
the destroyer. Making a split-second decision, Japanese
Commander Hanami ordered the helmsman
to spin the wheel to starboard and ram.</p>
<p>The <i>Amagiri</i> crashed into the starboard side of
the 109 and killed the lookout on the spot. The
boat was cut in two; the rear section sank; burning
gasoline covered the sea. The <i>Amagiri</i> sailed
on, but at a reduced speed, because the 109, in its
death agony, had bent vanes on the <i>Amagiri&rsquo;s</i>
starboard propeller, causing violent vibration at
high speeds.</p>
<p>PT 169 fired torpedoes at the <i>Amagiri</i>, but at
too close a range for them to arm and explode. PT
157 fired two that missed. Thirty torpedoes were
fired that night, and the only damage inflicted on
the destroyers was by the quite involuntary and
fatal body block of the 109. It was not the greatest
night of the war for the PT navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Eleven survivors of the 109 searched surrounding
waters for two missing shipmates, but never
found them. They spent the night and the next
morning on the still-floating bow section. By midafternoon
they decided that no rescue was on the
way. Since they felt naked and exposed to Japanese
plane and ship patrols, they set out to
swim three and a half miles to a desert island, the
skipper towing a badly burned shipmate for four
hours by a life-jacket tie-tie gripped between his
teeth.</p>
<p>After harrowing nights spent on several desert
islands&mdash;nights during which the skipper showed
most extraordinary stamina, resourcefulness, and
courage&mdash;the ship-wrecked sailors were found by
native scouts. They took the heroic skipper by canoe
to a coast-watcher station, and there he boarded a
rescue PT and returned for his marooned companions.</p>
<p>The skipper of the 109 was, of course, the
same John F. Kennedy who on January 20, 1961,
became the thirty-fifth President of the United
States.</p>
<p class="tb">After Munda fell and with it all of New Georgia,
American strategists studied the map and
decided that island-by-island reduction of Japanese
strength was too tedious. They decided to start
by-passing some of the bases, cutting off the by-passed
garrisons and starving them behind an
American sea blockade. More night work for the
PTs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Up the line a bit was the island of Vella Lavella,
only lightly held by the Japanese. American strategists
chose a beach called Barakoma as a possible
landing spot and ordered a reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Four PTs, on the night between August 12th and
13th, carried a scouting party of 45 men to the
beach at Barakoma. A Japanese plane nagged the
boats with strafing and bombing runs for two
hours. A near miss tore up the planking on the 168
and wounded four sailors, so the 168 had to drop
out of the operation, but the other three boats put
their passengers ashore safely. Scouts reported
that the only Japanese around that part of the island
were ship-wrecked survivors of an earlier sea battle,
so thirty-six hours later four more PTs landed
reinforcements.</p>
<p>Japanese snooper planes spotted the PT passenger
runs, but apparently the Japanese high command
couldn&rsquo;t think of torpedo boats as invasion
craft, so the scout landings were made without interference.</p>
<p>The main force followed, and by October 1st all
of Vella Lavella was in American hands.</p>
<p class="tb">The Japanese began shrinking their Solomon Islands
perimeter, falling back to the islands on the
near side of the new American base at Vella Lavella.
American destroyers, out to smash the
evacuation bargeline, met a Japanese destroyer
screen for the <i>daihatsus</i> on the night between October
6th and 7th. As usual, Japanese torpedoes
were deadly. One American destroyer went down
and two others were sorely damaged. More important,
the Japanese supply and evacuation train
ran its errands without molestation from the American
cans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The American destroyers did sink the Japanese
<i>Yugumo</i>, and American PTs were sent to pick up
78 survivors. Aboard the 163, an American sailor
offered a cup of coffee to one of the captive Japanese,
who killed the Good Samaritan (and of
course died himself at the hands of the murdered
sailor&rsquo;s shipmates). PT sailors felt less uneasy
about the massacre of the shipwrecked Japanese
at the Bismarck Sea after the treacherous murder
of their comrade by a rescued Japanese.</p>
<p class="tb">Having successfully leapfrogged once, American
strategists looked at the map again. The
whole point to the island-hopping campaign
was to put American fighter planes close enough to
Rabaul so that they could screen bombers over that
base and keep the Japanese pinned down there
under constant bombardment. The best site for a
fighter base was Bougainville Island, so American
planners put their fingers on the map and said:
&ldquo;This is the place for the next one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Accordingly, Marines landed at Cape Torokina,
on Bougainville, on November 1st. Their mission
was to capture enough of the island to build and
protect a fighter strip. The rest of the island could
be left to the 15,000 Japanese soldiers who defended
it. Nobody cared about them. Rabaul was
the real target.</p>
<p>The Japanese high command at Rabaul sent
down a cruiser-destroyer force with the mission
of getting among the American transports in Empress
Augusta Bay, off Torokina, and tearing up
the helpless train ships like a pack of wolves in a
herd of sheep.</p>
<p>An American cruiser-destroyer force met them
just after midnight on November 2nd, and sank one
Japanese cruiser and a destroyer. More important,
the American flotilla ran off the Japanese marauders
before they reached the transports.</p>
<p>American reconnaissance planes, however, spotted
a massive concentration of heavy cruisers
and destroyers building up in Rabaul Harbor, a
concentration too great for American naval forces
then in the South Pacific to handle, because most
American capital ships of the Pacific Fleet had
been pulled back toward Hawaii to support an
operation in the Gilbert Islands.</p>
<p>Admiral Halsey scratched together a carrier
task force, and even though a carrier raid near a
land-based airfield was then against doctrine, he
sent the carrier&rsquo;s planes into the harbor. They damaged
the cruisers badly enough to relieve the immediate
threat to the Torokina landings. The carrier
raids stirred up a hornet&rsquo;s nest around Rabaul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Eighteen Japanese torpedo bombers took off
to smash the brazen carrier task force. Just before
total dark they found American ships and attacked.
Radio Tokyo broadcast, with jubilation, that the
score in this &ldquo;First Air Battle of Bougainville&rdquo; was
&ldquo;one large carrier blown up and sunk, one medium
carrier set ablaze and later sunk, and two heavy
cruisers and one cruiser and destroyer sunk.&rdquo; Rabaul&rsquo;s
torpedo bombers won a group commendation.</p>
<p>An American staff officer, hearing the account of
this First Air Battle of Bougainville as reported by
Japanese pilots, could only hold his head in his
hands and hope his own pilots were not feeding
him the same kind of foolishness.</p>
<p>Here is what really happened in the First Air
Battle of Bougainville.</p>
<p>A landing craft, the LCI 70, and the PT 167,
were lumbering back from a landing party on the
Torokina beachhead. Just after sunset the Japanese
bombers struck in low-level torpedo runs. The PT
brought down the leader by the novel method of
snagging him with its mast. The plane&rsquo;s torpedo
punched clean through the PT&rsquo;s nose, leaving its tail
assembly, appropriately enough, in the crew&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The torpedo boat&rsquo;s 20-mm. cannon shot down a
second torpedo bomber so close to the ship that
the sailors on the fantail were soaked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Four torpedo bombers launched their fish at
the LCI, but since the torpedoes were set for
attack on a deep-draft carrier, they passed harmlessly
under the landing craft&rsquo;s shallow hull&mdash;except
for one which porpoised and jumped through
the LCI&rsquo;s thin skin, unfortunately killing one
sailor. The unexploded warhead came to rest on a
starchy bed in the bread locker. The torpedo was
still smoking, so the LCI&rsquo;s skipper, Lieut. (jg)
H. W. Frey, ordered &ldquo;Abandon ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed. No explosion. A damage-control
party reboarded the LCI and rigged her for a tow
back to Torokina. PT 167 raced ahead with the
wounded.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral T. S. Wilkinson radioed congratulations
to Ensign Theodore Berlin, skipper
of the PT, for knocking down a plane with his
mast. &ldquo;Fireplug sprinkles dog,&rdquo; is the way the admiral
put it.</p>
<p>So ended the First Air Battle of Bougainville.</p>
<p class="tb">PTs quickly set up a base on Puruata Island,
just off the Torokina beachhead, even though the
Marine foothold was still feeble. Sea patrols of the
torpedo boats were still vexed by poor communications.
The night of November 8th, for instance,
the destroyers <i>Hudson</i> and <i>Anthony</i> came up to
Torokina, sure that there were no friendly PTs in
the bay, because higher-ups on the beach had told
them so. Naturally, when radar picked up the pips
of patrolling PTs 163, 169 and 170, they let fly with
everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The PTs, equally misinformed about what
friendlies to expect, took the destroyer broadsides
to be a most unfriendly action and maneuvered for
a torpedo run. The skipper of the 170 tried to decoy
the two American destroyers into a trap. He
called the 163 by radio, to warn him that he was
leading &ldquo;three Nip cans&rdquo; into their torpedo range.
PT 163 got off a long shot at the &ldquo;three&rdquo; cans,
which fortunately missed.</p>
<p>There has been much fruitless speculation about
that third mysterious can reported by 170. Aboard
the 170, the radar screen showed a big target&mdash;not
one of the two American destroyers&mdash;10,000 yards
dead ahead. A salvo of shells that &ldquo;looked like ashcans&rdquo;
passed overhead, coming from the same direction
as the radar target. To this day nobody
knows who was the assailant with guns big enough
to fire ashcan-sized projectiles.</p>
<p>The running duel lit up the bay for forty-five
minutes. The torpedo boats were just coming
around for a new torpedo run when <i>Anthony</i> figured
out what was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humblest apologies,&rdquo; the <i>Anthony</i> said by radio
in a handsome bid to accept all the blame. &ldquo;We
are friendly vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p class="tb">Farther west near Arawe, on New Britain, on
Christmas Day 1943, Lieut. Ed Farley&rsquo;s 190, with
Lieut. Commander H. M. S. Swift aboard, and
Ensign Rumsey Ewing&rsquo;s 191 were returning to the
Dregar Harbor base in New Guinea, after a
dull patrol.</p>
<p>Between 30 and 38 Japanese dive bombers and
fighters came down from the north and bombed and
strafed the boats in groups of three and four. The
two little PTs were in a jam, for the force attacking
them was large enough to take on a carrier task
force, screen destroyers and all. The boats separated,
went to top speed, and zigzagged toward a
bank of low clouds twelve miles away.</p>
<p>Japanese planes often made one pass at PTs
and then dropped the job if they did not score,
but this overwhelming big flight of planes returned
for repeated attacks. PT skippers clamored
for fighter cover from the beach.</p>
<p>Aboard the 191, the skipper was hit in the lungs
and Ensign Fred Calhoun took command. A machine-gun
bullet pierced his thigh, but he hung on
to the wheel to play a deadly game of tag with the
attackers. He held a steady course, his eye fixed to
the bomb racks of the attacking plane, until the
bomb was away and committed to its course.
Then he whipped over the wheel to put the boat
where the bomb wasn&rsquo;t when it landed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Nevertheless, fragments from a near miss
knocked out a 20-mm. gun and severely wounded
the gunner, Chief Motor Machinist Mate Thomas
Dean, and the loader, Motor Machinist Mate Second
Class August Sciutto. Another near miss punched
an 18-inch hole in the portside and peppered the
superstructure with steel splinters.</p>
<p>Japanese strafers hit the port and starboard
engines and punctured the water jackets, which
spurted jets of boiling water into the engine room.
Engineer of the Watch Victor Bloom waded into
the streams of scalding water to tape and stuff
leaks so that the engines would not overheat and
fuse into a solid mass.</p>
<p>Fearing that the gas fumes from punctured
lines might explode, he closed off the fuel-tank
compartment and pulled a release valve to
smother it with carbon dioxide. When he had
tidied up his engine room, Bloom gave first aid to
the wounded. (Not surprisingly, Victor Bloom
won a Navy Cross for this action.)</p>
<p>By this time the two PTs had knocked four planes
into the sea near the boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the end of the attack,&rdquo; said Lieut. Farley,
&ldquo;the enemy became more and more inaccurate
and less willing to close us. It is possible that we
may have knocked down the squadron leader as
the planes milled about in considerable confusion,
as if lacking leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Forty minutes after they were called, P 47 fighter
planes from Finschhafen arrived to drive off the
shaken Japanese apparently startled by the two
floating buzz saws.</p>
<p>One of the P 47s was hit and made a belly landing
about half a mile from the 190. The pilot,
though badly wounded in the head and arm, freed
himself and escaped from the cockpit before his
plane went down. The 190 went to the rescue of
its rescuer, and Lieut. Commander Swift and
Seaman First Class Joe Cope jumped overboard to
tow the groggy pilot to the undamaged PT.</p>
<p>Authorities were as astonished as the Japanese
attackers had been by the savage and effective response
of the two PTs to the massive attack which
should have wiped them out, according to all the
rules. Smaller and less determined air attacks had
sunk cruisers and destroyers in other waters.</p>
<p>Commander Mumma, with justifiable pride in
his two boats, said of the action: &ldquo;It has shown that
the automatic weapon armament is most effective.
It has demonstrated that ably handled PTs can, in
daylight, withstand heavy air attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">On the same Christmas Day 1943, the Bougainville
bomber strip went into business, and the
fighter strips were so well established that American
forces could afford to settle down behind the
barbed wire of The Perimeter, content with what
they already held. From here on out, they could
afford to ignore as much as possible the 15,000
Japanese still on the island. From that day Rabaul
was doomed to comparative impotence under a
merciless shower of bombs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Not that Rabaul was a feeble outpost. One
hundred thousand Japanese soldiers, behind powerful
fortifications and with immense supplies, made
Rabaul a formidable fortress&mdash;too tough for a
direct frontal assault&mdash;until the end of the war.
Without air power, however, the Japanese there
could do nothing to hold back the Allied advance
except to glower at the task forces passing by just
out of gun range on their way to new island bases
farther up the line.</p>
<p>The Japanese gate was unhinged at both ends and
the Allies poured through the gap.</p>
<p>American strategists decided to jump over Rabaul,
leaving its defenders to shrivel away behind
a sea blockade. Some of the PTs leapfrogged
with the rest of the Allied forces and readied for
more night patrol in the waters farther along the
sea lanes to Tokyo; some of them stayed behind
to make life as miserable as possible for the bypassed
Japanese on Bougainville and the other
islands cut off from home.</p>
<p class="tb">PTs played a big part in the last jump that
isolated Rabaul. The landings in the Admiralty
Islands were on Leap Year Day, February 29,
1944, by units of the First Cavalry Division. The
Admiralty Islands are a ring of long, thin islands
enclosing a magnificent anchorage called Seeadler
Harbor. The fine anchorage and the airstrips
planned for the islands would give the Allies the
last brick in the wall around Rabaul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Faulty reconnaissance from the air had shown
that the islands were free of Japanese. Actually
there were 4,000 Japanese in the islands,
and their commander was insulted that the
Americans landed a force only a fraction the
size of his. He counterattacked violently. The
only Navy fire support available was from destroyers
and small craft.</p>
<p>Among the small craft were MTB Squadron
Twenty-One, commanded by Lieutenant Paul
Rennell, and Squadron Eighteen, commanded by
the same Lieut. Commander H. M. S. Swift who
had surprised the Japanese air command by the
vicious antiaircraft fire of his two torpedo boats
near Arawe on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The PTs went to work for the cavalry as a kind
of sea cavalry, running errands, carrying wounded,
towing stranded boats off the beach, handling the
leadline to measure a poorly charted harbor bottom,
and even carrying cavalry generals on scouting
missions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>From inside Seeadler Harbor they gave the cavalry
close fire support with machine guns and
mortars. A keen-eyed sailor on 363 knocked a
sniper out of a tree with a short burst, for instance,
and the crew of the 323 demolished, with 50
calibers, a Japanese radio and observation platform
in another tree.</p>
<p>The island of Manus fell quickly, and Major
General I. P. Swift, commanding general of the
First Cavalry Division, in a generous tribute to a
sister service, said: &ldquo;The bald statement, &lsquo;The
naval forces supported this action&rsquo; ... is indeed a
masterpiece of understatement.... Without the
Navy there would not have been any action.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">5.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Along the Turkey&rsquo;s Back</span></h2>
<p>From the time that American planes stopped
the Japanese onrush at the Coral Sea and at
Midway, it was a two-year job for the Allies to
batter down the Japanese gate at Rabaul and
at the Huon Gulf. Once the gate was down, it
took MacArthur&rsquo;s forces only four months to make
the 1,200-mile trip down the turkey&rsquo;s back to a
perch on the turkey&rsquo;s head, just across from the East
Indies and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The swift trip was made possible, however, by
a leap-frogging technique that left behind a monumental
job for the PT navy. General MacArthur
made almost all of his New Guinea landings
where the Japanese weren&rsquo;t, by-passing tens of
thousands of tough jungle fighters and leaving the
job of starving them out to the blockading navy.
Except for the brief loan of ships from the battle-line
for special missions, the blockading navy was
the PT fleet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The New Guinea PT force was beefed up for the
blockade by many new boats and officers. MacArthur
had been deeply impressed by the torpedo
boats during his escape from Corregidor and used
all his influence&mdash;which was considerable in those
days&mdash;to impress every PT possible into his force.</p>
<p>The PTs in New Guinea lost almost all use for
their torpedoes, except when they chanced to catch
a blockade-running supply submarine on the surface.
The boat skippers wanted more guns, more
auto-cannon and machine guns for shooting up the
Number One blockade-runner, the armored <i>daihatsu</i>&mdash;and
they got them.</p>
<p>Early in November 1943, Squadron Twenty-One
arrived at Morobe base armed with 40-mm. auto-cannon,
a tremendously effective weapon for all-around
mischief. It was the first New Guinea
squadron armed with the newer and deadlier
weapon.</p>
<p>More than the size of the new cannon, however,
the size of the new officers astonished the veteran
PT sailors. Commander Selman S. Bowling, who
had replaced Commander Mumma as chief of
PTs in the Southwest Pacific, had voluntarily ridden
on the Tulagi boats before his new assignment,
and he had decided then that PT officers should
be tough and athletic. When he went to the
States to organize new squadrons, he had recruited
the biggest, toughest athletes he could
find.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Among the newcomers were Ensign Ernest
W. Pannell, All-American tackle from Texas A.
and M. and professional football player for the
Green Bay Packers; Ensign Alex Schibanoff of
Franklin and Marshall College and the Detroit
Lions; Ensign Steven L. Levanitis of Boston College
and the Philadelphia Eagles; Ensign Bernard
A. Crimmins, All-American from Notre Dame;
Lieut. (jg) Paul B. Lillis, captain of the Notre
Dame team; Ensign Louis E. Smith, University
of California halfback; Ensign Kermit W. Montz,
Franklin and Marshall; Ensign John M. Eastham,
Jr., Texas A. and M.; Ensign Stuart A. Lewis,
University of California; Ensign Cedric J. Janien,
Harvard; and Ensign William P. Hall, Wabash.</p>
<p>Also bulging with muscle were Ensign Joseph
W. Burk, holding the world&rsquo;s record as single-sculls
champion; Ensign Kenneth D. Molloy, All-American
lacrosse player from Syracuse University;
Lieut. John B. Williams, Olympic swimmer from
Oregon State; and Ensign James F. Foran, swimmer
from Princeton.</p>
<p>Commander Bowling was right. PT crews had
to be tough for the kind of warfare they were
waging. Shallow-draft <i>daihatsus</i> clung to the
shore, and the PTs had to come in as close as 100
yards from the beach to find their prey. For 1,200
miles the shoreline was lined with ten of thousands
of blockaded Japanese soldiers, every one of them
itching to get a crack at the patrol boats that were
starving them to death. The Japanese set up shore
batteries and baited traps with helpless-looking
<i>daihatsus</i> to lure the PT marauders within range.
In this deadly cat-and-mouse game, the PT did
not always win.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p class="tb">About 2 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> on March 7th, PTs 337 and 338
slipped into Hansa Bay, a powerfully garrisoned
Japanese base by-passed early in the Allied forward
movement. The PTs poked about the enemy
harbor and picked up a radar target close to
shore. From 400 yards away, the two skippers saw
that their radar pip came from two heavily
camouflaged luggers moored together, a prime
bit of business for PTs. Before they could open
fire, however, they discovered that they had been
baited into an ambush.</p>
<p>Machine guns opened up on the beach, and the
PTs returned the fire, but the best they could do
was to strafe the bush at random, because the
Japanese gun positions were well concealed.</p>
<p>The machine guns at close range were bad
enough, but the PT crews &ldquo;pulled 20 Gs&rdquo; when a
heavy battery began firing from the mouth of the
bay. The PTs, already deep inside the bay, would
have to pass close to the heavy guns to escape from
the harbor. The worst was that the gunners were
obviously crack artillerymen, for the first shell hit so
close to the port bow of the 337 that water from
the spout sluiced down the decks and shrapnel
whizzed overhead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The sharpshooting gunners of the shore battery
put a shell from the next salvo into the tank compartment
below the port turret. All engines went
dead and the boat burst into flame. The skipper,
Ensign Henry W. Cutter, pulled the CO&#8322; release
valve but it was too late&mdash;the boat was doomed.</p>
<p>Francis C. Watson, Motor Machinist Mate, Third
Class, who had been blown from the port turret
by the shell blast, got to his feet and started forward,
away from the searing flames, but he turned
back into the fire to help William Daley, Jr.,
who was crawling painfully out of the burning engine
room. Daley had been badly wounded in the
neck and jaw. Watson pulled Daley from the
flames and with Morgan J. Canterbury, Torpedomen&rsquo;s
Mate, Second Class, carried him forward.
Ensign Cutter put a life raft into the water on the
side away from the big guns, and Daley, dazed
but obedient, tried to get into the raft, but slipped
overboard. The skipper and Ensign Robert W.
Hyde jumped after him and towed him to the
raft.</p>
<p>The crew paddled and pushed the raft away from
the burning boat and out to sea, but a strong current
worked against them and in two hours they made
only 700 yards. When their boat exploded, the
concussion hurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Searchlights swept the bay and guns fired all
night at the 338, which had escaped behind smoke
and was now trying to get back <i>into</i> the death-trap
to find out what had happened to their comrades
of the 337. The crack gunners ashore were too
good, however, and repeated brackets from heavy
salvos kept the 338 outside until the rising sun
drove the worried sailors home.</p>
<p>Daley died before sunrise, and&mdash;in the formal
language of the Navy report&mdash;&ldquo;was committed
to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Survivors clinging to the three-by-seven-foot balsa
oval were the skipper and Ensign Hyde, Watson,
Canterbury; Ensign Bruce S. Bales; Allen B.
Gregory, QM2c; Harry E. Barnett, RM2c; Henry
S. Timmons, Y2c; Edgar L. Schmidt, TM3c; Evo A.
Fucili, MoMM3c; and James P. Mitchell, SC3c.</p>
<p>The raft was not built for an 11-man load, so
the sailors took turns riding in the slat-bottom
craft and swimming alongside. Currents nagged
them, and at dawn the raft was still less than a
mile off the entrance to the bay, within easy
reach of Japanese patrol boats.</p>
<p>During the morning the currents set the boat
toward Manam Island, six miles away, and Ensign
Cutter decided to make for the island, with
the idea that he and his crew would hide in the
woods. Maybe they would find food, water, shelter&mdash;who
knows, just possibly a native canoe or
sailboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>All afternoon the sailors paddled for the island,
but the devilish currents were not through with
them. Every time they came close to the beach a
current would sweep them out to sea again.</p>
<p>Floating on the same currents were two logs
which the sailors tied to the raft. After dark the
skipper, still hopeful of finding a boat on the island,
set out with Ensign Bales to swim to the beach,
using the logs as a crude substitute for water
wings. For three hours the two young officers swam,
only to bump gently against their own raft again.
The currents had carried them in a giant circle,
back to their starting point.</p>
<p>Hyde and Gregory, tired of inaction, set out for
the beach. They were never seen again.</p>
<p>That night the sailors watched the flash of gunfire
at Hansa Bay, where their squadron mates shot up
the beach in revenge for their loss. No PTs came
close enough for the shipwrecked sailors to hail.</p>
<p>By their very nature, PT sailors were men of
action. Their solution to any problem was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
just sit there, <i>do</i> something.&rdquo; The inactivity of
waiting passively for rescue was too much for
some of them.</p>
<p>Just before dawn Mitchell set out for the island,
and just after dawn Ensign Bales, Fucili,
Watson, and Schmidt followed. The others would
have gone, too, but they were too weak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Watson returned to the raft in the middle of the
morning. He had swum to within 75 yards of the
shore, he said, and he had seen Ensign Bales
walking around on dry land, but he had also seen
Japanese workmen building boats in a shipyard,
so he came back to the raft. All hands abandoned
the idea of going to the island. After the war,
captured documents showed that the Japanese on
Manam Island had captured one officer and two
enlisted men of the sailors who had swum ashore,
but these three luckless sailors were never heard
of after this brief mention.</p>
<p>That night, their third in the water, the sailors
were exposed to a nerve-racking and mysterious
inspection. A small boat pulled out from shore and
circled the raft at 200 yards. Two Japanese trained
a brace of machine guns on the Americans, but held
their fire. The shivering sailors looked down the
muzzles of those two machine guns until four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when a squall with six-foot
waves drove the patrol craft back to the beach.
After the squall passed, the PT sailors were alone
again&mdash;more alone than ever, for the delirious
Canterbury had swum away during the storm.
Barnett, a first-rate swimmer, had chased after
Canterbury to bring him back, but had lost him in
the heavy seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>That morning the five surviving sailors spied an
overturned Japanese boat. It was fifteen feet
long and a luxurious yacht compared to their
flimsy raft, so they righted the boat and bailed it
out. A crab was running about the bottom, and
during the chase for this tasty tidbit the sailors
let their life raft drift away. Nobody really cared;
they had no fond memories of the balsa boat.</p>
<p>The sailors suffered horribly from thirst and they
eagerly pulled in a drifting coconut, but it was
dry. They were badly sunburned and covered
with salt-water sores. Another chilly night and
another blazing morning passed without relief.</p>
<p>At noon on March 10th, three Army B 25s flew
over. The planes circled the frantically waving
sailors, and Ensign Cutter sent a message by semaphore,
a dubious method of communication with
Army pilots, but better than nothing.</p>
<p>One bomber dropped a box which collapsed and
sank. On his next pass, he dropped two more
boxes and a small package fixed to a life preserver.
They plunked into the sea not ten feet from
the boat. The sailors eagerly tore open the packages
and found food, water, cigarettes, and medicine.
A marked chart showed them their position, and
a message said a Catalina flying boat was on its
way to pick them up.</p>
<p>The Catalina took its time, however, for the
sailors had one more trying night to endure before
the Cat, screened by two P 47s, landed on the
water and picked up the five exhausted survivors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p class="tb">The old problem of bad communications between
the different services bothered the PTs worse than
ever in New Guinea waters.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 27th, Lieut. Crowell C.
Hall, on Ensign George H. Guckert&rsquo;s PT 353,
accompanied by Ensign Richard B. Secrest&rsquo;s 121,
went into Bangula Bay to investigate a reported
enemy schooner.</p>
<p>That morning, at Australian fighter squadron
headquarters on Kiriwina Island, a careless clerk
put the report of the PT patrol in the wrong file
basket, so fighter pilots flew over Bangula Bay, with
the information that no friendly PTs would be
out. This was the same setup that had already
caused repeated tragedies and near-tragedies in
other waters.</p>
<p>At 7:45 in the morning, admittedly an unusual
hour for the night-prowling PTs to be abroad,
four P 40s of the Australian squadron flew over the
boats. Lieut. Hall asked them, by radio, to investigate
the schooner, which was beyond a dangerous
reef from the PT boats. The plane pilots
looked it over and told the PT skipper that it had
already been badly strafed and wasn&rsquo;t worth attacking
further.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The boats turned to go home. Four other P 40s
and two Beaufighters of the same squadron came
down out of the sun in a strafing run on the PTs.
One of the Beaufighter pilots recognized the boats
and frantically tried to call his mates off the attack,
but nobody listened. The gallant Australian
pilot even put his fighter between the strafing
planes and the boats, trying to block the attack
with his own body. No luck.</p>
<p>The PT officers held their men under tight
discipline for several punishing runs, but the
nerves of the gunners finally gave way, and
each boat fired a short burst from 37- and 40-mm.
cannon and the 50-caliber machine guns. The
officers sharply ordered a cease-fire, and for the
rest of the attack the PT crews suffered helplessly
while the planes riddled their craft and
killed their shipmates. Both boats exploded and
sank.</p>
<p>The first quartet of P 40s, the planes that had
chatted with Lieut. Hall, rushed back to the scene
when they heard the radio traffic between the
attacking fighters and suspected what was happening.
They dropped a life raft to the swimming
survivors and radioed headquarters the story of the
disaster. Two PTs were dispatched to the rescue.</p>
<p>Four officers and four enlisted men were killed,
four officers and eight enlisted men were wounded,
two PT boats were lost to the deadly fire of the
friendly fighters&mdash;all because one slipshod clerk
had put a piece of paper in a wrong file basket.</p>
<p class="tb">Even worse was coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The combat zone in the Pacific was divided into
the Southwest and the South Pacific commands.
Communication between the two commands at
the junior officer level was almost nonexistent.
Everybody was supposed to stay in his own
backyard and not cross the dividing line.</p>
<p>On the night of April 28th, Lieut. (jg) Robert
J. Williams&rsquo; 347 was patrolling with Lieut. (jg)
Stanley L. Manning&rsquo;s 350. The 347 went hard
aground on a reef at Cape Pomas, only five miles
from the dividing line between the south and
southwest zones. Lieut. Manning passed a line to
the stranded boat, and the two crews set about
the all-too-familiar job of freeing a PT from
an uncharted rock.</p>
<p>At 7 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> two Marine Corps Corsairs from the
South Pacific zone, through faulty navigation,
crossed the dividing line without knowing it.
Naturally they had no word of these PTs patrolling
in their area, because they weren&rsquo;t in their
area. They attacked.</p>
<p>The PTs did not recognize the Corsairs as
friendly, and shot one of them down. (This is an
extraordinary mistake, also, for the gull-winged Corsair
was probably the easiest of all warplanes on
both sides to identify, especially from the head-on
view presented during a strafing run.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Three men were killed in the first attack on the
350, and both boats were badly damaged. The
skippers called for help. The tender <i>Hilo</i>, at
Talasea, asked for air cover from Cape Gloucester
(in the Southwest Pacific zone and hence out of
communications with the South Pacific base of
the Corsair pilots). The tender sent Lieut. (jg)
James B. Burk to the rescue in PT 346.</p>
<p>The pilot of the surviving Corsair reported to
his base at Green Island, in the South Pacific
zone, that he had attacked two Japanese gunboats
125 feet long in Lassul Bay. (The PTs were
slightly more than half that long. Lassul Bay was
actually 20 miles from Cape Pomas, the true
scene of the attack, and hence fifteen miles inside
the South Pacific zone and not in the Southwest
Pacific zone.)</p>
<p>Green Island scrambled four Corsairs, six Avengers,
four Hellcats, and eight Dauntless dive bombers
to finish off the stricken PTs. The powerful
striking force, enough air-power to take on a
cruiser division, found no boats in Lassul Bay, but
they, too, wandered across the dividing line and
found the PTs at Cape Pomas.</p>
<p>By then the 346 had arrived. The skipper saw
the approaching planes, but recognized them as
friendly types and thought they were the air cover
from Cape Gloucester, so the PT crews ignored
the planes and continued with the salvage and
rescue work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>First hint that something had gone wrong was
a shower of bombs that burst among the PT
boats. The PT officers frantically tried every
trick in the catalogue to identify themselves, and
in despair finally turned loose their gunners, who
shot down one of the planes. The loss of one of
their mates angered the pilots and they pressed
their attacks harder. Two of the three PTs went
down.</p>
<p>The plane flight commander called for a Catalina
rescue boat to pick up the downed pilot. The
Cat never found the pilot, but instead picked up
thirteen survivors of the torpedo boats. Their
arrival at Green Island was the first word the
horrified pilots there had that their targets had been
friendly.</p>
<p>Three PT officers and 11 men were killed,
two plane pilots were lost, four officers and nine
men were wounded, two PTs and two planes were
destroyed, in this useless and tragic encounter.</p>
<p class="tb">Most PT patrols were not as disastrous, of
course, but it was a rare night that did not provide
some adventure. Lieut. (jg) James Cunningham
kept a diary during 1944, and a few extracts
from this journal show the nature of a typical
PT&rsquo;s blockade duty:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<blockquote>
<p><i>March 12, 1944</i>: PTs 149 (<i>The Night Hawk</i>)
and 194 patrol the north coast of New Britain.
At 2300 we picked up a target on radar&mdash;closed
in and saw a small Jap surface craft.
We made a run on it and found out it was
aground and apparently destroyed. We destroyed
it some more.</p>
<p>We moved to the other side of Garove
Island, where we saw a craft under way
heading across the mouth of the harbor. Over
one part of the harbor were very high cliffs,
an excellent spot for gun emplacements. We
blindly chased the craft and closed in on it
for a run. Just then the guns&mdash;six-inchers&mdash;opened
up from the cliffs on us, and it seemed
for a while that they would blow us out
of the water. We left the decoy and headed
out to sea, laying a smoke screen. The concussion
of the exploding shells was terrific. I
still believe the craft was a decoy to pull us
into the harbor, and we readily took the bait.
The thing that saved us was that the Japs
were too eager. They fired too soon before we
were really far into the harbor. On the way
home, about 10 miles offshore from New Britain,
we picked up three large radar pips and
figured they were enemy destroyers, because
they were in enemy waters and we were authorized
to destroy anything in this grid sector.
We chased within one mile, tracking them
with radar, and got set to make our run. We
could see them by eye at that range and
identified them as a destroyer and two large
landing craft.</p>
<p>We radioed for airplanes to help us with
this valuable prize. Just as we started our
torpedo run from about 500 yards away, the
destroyer shot a recognition flare and identified
themselves as friendly. It was a close
call. We were within seconds of firing our
fish. The task unit was off course and had
wandered into a forbidden zone.</p>
<p><i>June 23, 1944</i>: PTs 144 (<i>The Southern
Cross</i>) and 189 departed Aitape Base, New
Guinea, for patrol to the west.</p>
<p>We closed the beach at Sowam after noticing
lots of lights moving. They appeared
to be trucks, moving very slow. Muffled down,
hidden by a black, moonless night, we sneaked
to within 150 yards off the beach and waited
for a truck to come around the bend and onto
the short stretch of road that ran along the
beach. Here came one, lights blazing. Both
boats blasted away. The truck burst into
flames and stopped, lights still burning. The
last we saw of the truck (shore batteries
fired on us immediately, so we got out) it
was still standing there with headlights burning
and flames leaping up in the New Guinea
night. It has become quite a sport, by the
way, shooting enemy trucks moving along
the beach with lights on. The Japs never
seem to learn. We fire at them night after
night. They turn off the lights briefly, then
they turn them back on again when they think
we have gone. But we haven&rsquo;t gone. We
shoot them up some more, and they turn
off the lights again. And so on all night long.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The Japanese apparently smarted under these
truck-busting attacks, for Lieut. Cunningham&rsquo;s entry
three nights later tells a different story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>June 26, 1944</i>: PTs 144 and 149 left Aitape
Base, New Guinea, to patrol toward Sowam
Village, where the road comes down to the
beach. We were after trucks. We closed
cautiously to three-quarters of a mile off
the beach, then it seemed that everything
opened up on us, 50 and 30 calibers, 40 mms
and three-inchers. At the time they fired on us
we were dead in the water, with all three
engines in neutral. To get the engines into
gear, the drill is to signal the engine room
where the motor mack of the watch puts
the engine in gear by hand. There is no
way to do it from the cockpit. Then, when
the gears are engaged, the skipper can control
the speed by three throttles.</p>
<p>I was at the helm in the cockpit when the
batteries opened fire, and I shoved all three
throttles wide open, forgetting that the gears
weren&rsquo;t engaged. Of course, the boat almost
shook apart from the wildly racing engines, but
we didn&rsquo;t move. The motor mack in the engine
room below wrestled against me to push
the throttles back. He was stronger than I
was and finally got the engines slowed down
enough to put them into gear. <i>Then</i> we got
moving fast. We made it out to sea OK without
being hit, but I sure pulled a boo boo that
time.</p>
<p><i>August 28, 1944</i>: PTs 188 and 144 west toward
Hollandia, with a squad of Army radio-men
aboard to contact a land patrol. This is
enemy-held territory and the patrol was in
hopes of taking a few prisoners.</p>
<p>Just after sunrise we received a radio
message to pick up Jap prisoners at Ulau
Mission. We proceeded to the mission and I
asked some P 39s that were strafing the beach
to cover us while we made the landing.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Harry Suttenfield, skipper of
the 188, and I launched a life raft and
headed in to pick up prisoners from the
Army patrol.</p>
<p>We made it OK until we got into the
surf, then the breakers swamped us. There
were many dead Japs lying around, and
the soldiers were burning the village. The
natives took the prisoners out to the boats
and then swam us through the surf, pushing
the raft.</p>
<p>We turned the prisoners over to the Army
at Aitape.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>More and more as the by-passed Japanese
became progressively demoralized by lack of food
and rest, the PTs were pressed into service as
Black Marias, police vans for carrying Japanese
captives from the front lines, or even from behind
the lines, to Army headquarters where Intelligence
officers interrogated the prisoners.</p>
<p>Most Japanese simply would not be captured,
and killed themselves rather than surrender. Many
of them made dangerous prisoners, for they surrendered
only to get close enough to their captors
to kill them with concealed weapons.</p>
<p class="tb">On the night of July 7, 1944, Lieut. (jg)
William P. Hall, on the 329, dropped a fatal
depth charge under a 130-foot lugger south of
Cape Oransbari. The crew snagged four prisoners,
one of them a lieutenant colonel, one of the
highest ranking officers taken prisoner in New
Guinea.</p>
<p>One of the prisoners attacked Lieut. Hall,
who flattened him with a right to the mouth. Hall
sprained his thumb and badly gashed his hand
on the prisoner&rsquo;s teeth. He was awarded the
Purple Heart for being wounded &ldquo;in the face
of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, what few Japanese did let
themselves be taken made docile, even eagerly
cooperative, prisoners. PT crewmen could never
tell what was coming on a Black Maria mission.
Either the captives tried to kill themselves
or their guards&mdash;or they tried to help the guards
kill their former comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p class="tb">On the night between March 16th and 17th,
Lieut. H. M. S. Swift (the Lieut. Swift of the
great air battle at Aitape) was out with Lieut. (jg)
Eugene E. Klecan&rsquo;s 367 and 325. Off Pak Island,
the two boats caught nine Japanese in a canoe.
As the PTs approached, one Japanese killed himself
and three others with a grenade. Another was
shot by PT sailors when he resisted capture.
The others came aboard willingly.</p>
<p>One of the captives asked for a pencil and
wrote: &ldquo;My name is Kamingaga. After finished
Ota High School, I worked in a Yokohama army
factory as an American spy. I set fire to Yokohama&rsquo;s
arsenal. Later, I was conscripted into
the Japanese army, unfortunately. I was very unhappy,
but now I am very happy because I was
saved by American Army. To repay your kindness
I will work as a spy for your American
Army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was turned over to skeptical Army officers,
who did not make a deal with the traitorous
captive.</p>
<p class="tb">Another Japanese canary, however, sang a most
profitable song to his captors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>On the night between April 28th and 29th,
Ensign Francis L. Cappaert, in 370, and Ensign
Louis A. Fanget, in 388, sank three barges in
Nightingale Bay, east of Wewak.</p>
<p>One of the barges had been loaded with two
75-mm. cannon and 45 soldiers. The PT crews
tried to pull prisoners from the water, but all
but two deliberately drowned themselves.</p>
<p>One of the two captives said to Ensign
Cappaert, &ldquo;Me officer,&rdquo; and eagerly volunteered the
advice that more barges were coming into Nightingale
Bay in a few minutes. The PT skippers
didn&rsquo;t know what kind of trap their prisoner
might be baiting for them, but they stayed
around anyhow. Three more barges came around
the bend on schedule, however, and the PT&rsquo;s riddled
them from ambush as &ldquo;Me Officer&rdquo; looked on.</p>
<p>The only surviving Japanese from the last three
barges was a courier with a consignment of secret
documents. The first lesson drilled into American
sailors was that all secret documents, code books,
maps, and combat instruction, were to go to the
bottom if capture was imminent. The Japanese
courier clung to his package, at some risk to
himself, for it would have been easier to
swim without it. He willingly turned over the
secret papers to the PT officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>At headquarters in Aitape, officers questioned
the prisoners in their own language, and to the
astonishment of the Navy, the Japanese officer
dictated a barge movement timetable that helped
PTs knock off fifteen barges and a picket boat
in the next five nights.</p>
<p>Commander Robert J. Bulkley, Jr., a PT veteran
who later became the official naval historian
of the PT fleet (not to be confused with John
Bulkeley of the MacArthur rescue mission), said
of the Japanese conduct as prisoners:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them preferred death to capture, but
once taken prisoner they were usually docile
and willing, almost eager, to give information.
And while their information might be limited,
it was generally reliable. They seldom attempted
deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big job was to capture them, and PT
crews became fairly adept at it. One method
was to crack a man over the head with a boathook
and haul him up on deck. Another technique,
more certain, was to drop a cargo net
over the bow. Two men climbed down on the
net. Other members of the crew held them by
lines around their waist so that their hands were
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would blackjack the floating Japanese
and put a line on him so that he could be hauled
aboard. Those were rough methods, but the gentle
ones didn&rsquo;t work. The Japanese almost never took
a line willingly, and as long as they were conscious
would fight to free themselves from a boathook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>As a nice contrast to this careless betrayal of
secret information by the Japanese, consider an
American PT officer&rsquo;s reaction to the loss of a secret
code book.</p>
<p>On the night of April 2nd, the 114 went
aground 400 yards off Yarin, on Kairiru Island.
The crew jettisoned torpedoes and depth
charges and the boat was pulled off the rock by
<i>The Southern Cross</i> (144). The propellers were so
badly damaged, however, that the 114 was abandoned.
Confidential publications, including a code
book, were put into a raft, but the crew carelessly
let it drift to the Japanese-held beach.</p>
<p>When the boats returned to the tender, the
skipper reported the loss of the codes to Lieut.
Commander Robert Leeson, who jumped into 129,
commanded by his brother Ensign A. D. Leeson,
and took off for Yarin. Ensign Edmund F. Wakelin
tagged along in 134.</p>
<p>The two PTs hove to off the beach at Yarin, and
the officers studied the situation. They could
see the raft on the shore, but it was in full view
of a Japanese military hut, 600 yards away, and
Yarin was the site of a known powerful shore battery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Commander Leeson wanted those books, though,
and he wanted them badly, so he jumped over the
side and in full daylight swam the 400 yards
across the reef to the beach. While crews of
the two boats watched the beach with fingers
crossed, dreading the sight of the first puff of
flame from the hidden shore battery, Commander
Leeson pushed the raft into the water
and towed it back to the boat. The secret
publications were taken aboard intact.</p>
<p>The Japanese chose that moment&mdash;the moment
just after their last chance&mdash;to wake up and plunk
a salvo of shells around the boats.</p>
<p>Commander Leeson, not satisfied with having
saved the PT code in one of the most
daring exploits of the Pacific war, decided to
hang around until after nightfall. After all, the
PTs had come all that long way from the tender
and had not yet worked any mischief.</p>
<p>After dark the boats slipped in close to the
beach and sank two out of three heavily loaded
barges. The third barge blew a 14-inch hole in
the exhaust stack of the 196, knocked out the
starboard engine, and started a fire.</p>
<p>Clarence L. Nelson, MoMM2c, put out the fire,
but he and A. F. Hall, MoMM3c, passed out from
the fumes. Ensign Richard Holt dropped his battle
duties long enough to give the two sailors
artificial respiration, and very probably saved
Hall&rsquo;s life. The 129&rsquo;s engine was definitely dead,
however, and nothing would bring it back to
life, so Commander Leeson went on fighting with
two-thirds power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>After airing out the 129&rsquo;s engine room, the
redoubtable Leeson, with his crippled boat, led a
limping charge straight into the mouth of the Japanese
cannon. The two boats launched a ripple of
twenty-four rockets at close range, and nothing
more was heard from the beach.</p>
<p>When the sky turned light in the east, Commander
Leeson took his sailors home.</p>
<p class="tb">The spearhead of the Allied advance left
New Guinea for Morotai Island in September
1944. The landings there were supported by
navy planes from six escort carriers. On D-Day
plus one, Ensign Harold Allen Thompson took off
from the deck of the carrier <i>Santee</i> in his fighter
plane to strafe Japanese positions around Wasile
Bay on nearby Halmahera. His sortie touched off
one of the most heroic adventures of the Pacific
war.</p>
<p>According to the report of the carrier division
commander: &ldquo;Success of the landings on Morotai
depended upon keeping the Japanese continually
on the defensive ... thus making it impossible for
them to launch counteroffensives until American
forces were established in strength on the smaller
island [Morotai].&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Ensign Thompson&rsquo;s job was to beat up Japanese
barges in Wasile Bay. While he was in a
steep dive on his fourth strafing run, the Japanese
made a direct hit with a heavy shell on
Ensign Thompson&rsquo;s plane.</p>
<p>The carrier division commander reports:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing he knows he was being
blown <i>upward</i> with such force that his emergency
gear was even blown out of his pockets. He
pulled the ripcord and on the way down he found
himself literally looking down the barrels of almost
every gun in the Japanese positions about 300
yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hitting the water, he discovered that his
left hand had been badly torn, presumably by
shrapnel. His life jacket had been torn in front
and would only half inflate. His main idea was to
get away from the beach and out into the bay,
but progress was difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrades stayed with the downed pilot and
strafed the beach until a PBY patrol plane came,
but the rescue Cat could not land. The pilot
dropped a life raft instead, and Ensign Thompson
climbed aboard. He put a tourniquet on his
bleeding hand and then paddled to a pier to
hide in the shelter of a camouflaged lugger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These pilots heroically covered all the beach
area with a devastating attack so that little or
no fire could be directed at the pilot in the
raft,&rdquo; says the division report. &ldquo;The attacks drove
the Japanese gunners to shelter, but after the attacks
they returned to their guns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Ensign Thompson said it was a wonderful show
to watch, but it was a tragically expensive show.
Ensign William P. Bannister was hit and crashed
150 yards from Ensign Thompson, gallantly giving
his life to save his fellow pilot.</p>
<p>Ensign Paul W. Lindskog was also hit, but flew
his wobbly plane safely to a crash landing outside
the Japanese lines. Almost all the planes were
holed, but they continued the strafing runs until
Thompson had worked his way behind the armored
lugger.</p>
<p>When fuel ran low, another flight of fighters
came up to strafe, and the carrier set up a system
of shuttle flights to keep the beach under constant
attack.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But how to get Ensign Thompson
out of Wasile Bay if a Catalina couldn&rsquo;t land
there? After all, the fighters couldn&rsquo;t cover the
wounded pilot till the war was over. Somebody
thought about the PT fleet, and so the carrier
division commander called the PT tender <i>Oyster
Bay</i> and asked if there was anything the
PTs could do.</p>
<p>Certainly there was something the PTs could do;
they could rescue the pilot.</p>
<p>Lieut. Arthur Murray Preston, commander of
Squadron Thirty-Three, picked two all-volunteer
crews, and they put to sea in Lieut. Wilfred Tatro&rsquo;s
489 and Lieut. (jg) Hershel F. Boyd&rsquo;s 363.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The boat arrived off the mouth of Wasile Bay
in the middle of the afternoon. Lieut. Preston
knew there was a minefield, backed up by a light
shore battery, at the eastern side of the entrance.
A powerful and hitherto unsuspected battery
opened fire on the western shore, however, and
Preston chose the lesser danger of the minefield
and the lighter battery.</p>
<p>Shorefire from both beaches was so heavy that
the PTs had to fall back. The fighter pilots spotted
their difficulty and made strafing runs on the
shore batteries. The Japanese guns still fired on the
PTs, but at a slower rate, and Lieut. Preston decided
to risk a run through the narrow straits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strafing by the planes unquestionably reduced
the rate of fire to make a safe passage through
the straits possible,&rdquo; said Lieut. Preston. &ldquo;Safe&rdquo;
passage, indeed!</p>
<p>The inside was no improvement on the entrance,
for the bay was small and ringed with
guns, all of which could reach the PTs. The
shooting was steadily improving also as Japanese
gunners found the range.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) George O. Stouffer called from
his torpedo bomber to ask Lieut. Preston if
he would like to have a little smoke between the
PTs and the shore gunners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Would he like a little smoke? Just all there is.
Stouffer flew between the PTs and the beach,
laying a dense curtain of smoke to blind the gunners.
He dropped one smoke pot squarely over a
particularly dangerous gun battery, blanking off its
view in all directions. The plane also dropped a
smoke float to mark the location of the downed
pilot&rsquo;s raft.</p>
<p>During the approach of the two PTs to the
armored lugger, they added their guns to those
of the planes lashing the beach, but lookouts
kept a nervous watch on the Japanese boat&mdash;nobody
could be sure that the lugger was not
manned by enemy sailors waiting to shoot up
the rescue craft at the moment they were most
occupied with the downed pilot. The closer the
boats came to the lugger, the more the planes concentrated
their fire on the nearby beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This strafing was maintained at an almost unbelievable
intensity during the entire time the boats
were in the vicinity of the downed pilot. This
was the ultimate factor in the success of the
mission,&rdquo; reads Lieut. Preston&rsquo;s report, which makes
no mention of another factor&mdash;the incredible tenaciousness
of the two PT crews.</p>
<p>The first smoke screen was beginning to thin
dangerously when the 363 hove to beyond the
lugger and raked the beach with its guns.</p>
<p>The 489 went alongside the lugger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately and on their own initiative, Lieut.
D. F. Seaman and C. D. Day, MoMM1c, dove
overboard and towed the pilot in his boat to the
stern of 489. The pilot was in no condition to do
this for himself and appeared to be only partly conscious
of his circumstances and surroundings,&rdquo;
wrote Preston. The rescue took ten minutes.</p>
<p>The PTs were not through fighting yet. Lieut.
Heston remembered that the primary mission
of PTs in those waters was destruction of Japanese
coastal shipping, so he ordered the two PTs to
put a few holes in the lugger and set it afire
before leaving.</p>
<p>The fighter cover ran low on fuel, and there
was a near-disastrous breakdown in the shuttle
timetable.</p>
<p>Preston reports what happened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were hove-to picking up Thompson
there was a group of planes giving us the closest
possible cover and support. As we left the
scene the planes did not remain quite as close
to us as they had previously.... It was shortly
after this that we learned that the fighters were
critically low on fuel and some of them out of
ammunition. Nevertheless, they were still answering
our calls to quiet one gun or another, sometimes
having to dive on the gun positions without firing,
because their own magazines were empty.... They
were magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The PTs zigzagged across the minefield with
heavy shells bursting within ten yards on all sides.
When they finally broke into the open sea and
roared away from the enemy beach, Ensign Thompson
had been in the water for seven hours, the PTs
had been under continuous close-range fire from
weapons of all calibers for two and one-half
hours. The boats were peppered with shrapnel,
but, miraculously, none of the PT sailors had been
scratched.</p>
<p>Dr. Eben Stoddard had a job, though, trying to
save the pilot&rsquo;s left hand, which was so badly
mangled by shrapnel that three fingers dangled
loosely.</p>
<p>The seven hours of protective strafing had blown
up an ammunition dump, destroyed a fuel dump,
wrecked stores, silenced four heavy gun positions
at least temporarily, and certainly prevented
the Japanese from getting to the downed pilot.</p>
<p>Lieut. Preston was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor for this action, one of the two
Congressional Medals of Honor awarded to PT
sailors. (The other was given to Lieut. John Bulkeley
for his exploits during the fall of the Philippines.)
The two swimmers and the two skippers
won the Navy Cross. Every other member of
the two crews won a Silver Star.</p>
<p>Ironically, the day after incredible escape of all
PT hands without injury, Lieut. Tatro, skipper of
the 489, while working on a 20-mm gun, let a
wrench slip and a trunnion spring threw the
heavy tool into his forehead, injuring him seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p class="tb">By November 1944, there was no more work for
the PTs in New Guinea, and the last patrol was
made just twenty-three months after the first
one, 1,500 miles to the east. The PT navy in New
Guinea had grown from one small tender and six
boats to eight tenders and 14 squadrons.</p>
<p>Almost nightly action had taken a terrible toll of
the Japanese. The shore was littered with the
wreckage of <i>daihatsus</i> and the jungle was littered
with the skeletons of thousands of Japanese soldiers
who had died for lack of supplies.</p>
<p>Major General F. H. Berryman, Commander
of the Second Australian Corps, wrote the PT
commander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following evidence emerging from the
recent operations will illustrate the cumulative
effect of the activities of your command:</p>
<p class="tb">A. The small degree to which the enemy
has used artillery indicates a shortage of
ammunition.</p>
<p>B. The enemy, in an endeavor to protect
his barges, has been forced to dispose his
normal field artillery over miles of coast
when those guns might well have been used in
the coastal sector against our land troops.</p>
<p>C. Many Japanese diary entries describe the
shortage of rations and the regular fatigues of
foraging parties to collect native food, which
is beginning to be increasingly difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>D. A Japanese prisoner of war stated that
three days&rsquo; rice, augmented by native food,
now has to last nine days. This is supported
by the absence of food and the presence of
native roots on enemy dead.</p>
<p>E. There is definite evidence that the enemy
has slaughtered and eaten his pack-carrying
animals.</p>
<p class="tb">From the above you will see how effective
has been the work of your squadrons and how
it has contributed to the recent defeat of the
enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The war in New Guinea was over, but the Allies
were still a long way from Tokyo. Across the
water were the Philippine Islands, garrisoned with
tens of thousands of Japanese. There was hard
fighting ahead for the PTs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The War in Europe:</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">Mediterranean</span></h2>
<p>While Americans and their Allies were fighting
the Japanese in the Pacific, on the other side
of the world their comrades in arms grappled
in a Titanic struggle with the other two Axis
powers. Half of the European Axis partnership
was halfhearted Italy, but the other half was
the martial and determined state of Germany,
led by an insane genius at the black arts of killing
named Hitler.</p>
<p>The naval war in the coastal waters of Europe
was eminently suitable to torpedo-boat operations.
The British had been making spectacular
use of motor torpedo boats for years&mdash;in fact,
American PTs had been patterned after British
models. The Axis powers also used torpedo
boats. German E-boats prowled the English
Channel and the Mediterranean. Even the Italian
MAS boats made Allied Mediterranean naval
commanders nervous, for the torpedo boat had
been an Italian specialty since its invention and
the officers who manned Italian small craft were
the most aggressive and warlike in all the Italian
Armed Forces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>American troops went ashore in Northwest
Africa on November 8, 1942. (On the other side of
the world, the Japanese were just forming the massive
relief fleet that was smashed and dispersed
definitively a week later in the great three-day sea
battle of Guadalcanal.) The United States Navy
rushed to put American torpedo boats into the
Mediterranean to join the British in harrying Axis
shipping.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, in late 1942, Squadron Fifteen
was organized. Its commander was Lieut. Commander
Stanley Barnes, destined to become probably
the most dashing of all American PT sailors,
as the squadron itself was to become the most
spectacularly successful PT command in either
theatre.</p>
<p>On commissioning day the squadron members
didn&rsquo;t feel elated about their future. Their first assignment
was to patrol the warm blue waters off
Midway Island, far behind the fighting lines in
the Pacific. While the Tulagi PTs fought almost
nightly battles with Tanaka&rsquo;s Tokyo Express, Squadron
Fifteen was promised long, lazy afternoons of
cribbage, 3,500 miles behind the combat zone. Its
assignment gave its members slight headaches
every time they thought about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Lieut. Commander Barnes assured his squadron
mates that somehow, somewhere, he was going to
find somebody for them to fight. But nobody believed
him&mdash;not even he, as he later confessed.</p>
<p>The squadron sailed for the Panama Canal and
was well on the way to the gentle duties of Midway
when the radioman came running with a dispatch.</p>
<p>Orders to Midway were canceled! &ldquo;Report to
Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, in Norfolk,&rdquo;
the message read.</p>
<p>At the giant Virginia naval base, Barnes had his
conference with the upper echelons of brass and
rushed back to his squadron mates with the news
that they were indeed going to find somebody
somewhere to fight. They were going to the Mediterranean
as the first American torpedo-boat
squadron on the European scene.</p>
<p>The barman at the Navy Officers&rsquo; Club in Norfolk
was famous in those days&mdash;and may still be&mdash;for
his Stingers, a most appropriate toast to duty
in the Mediterranean mosquito fleet.</p>
<p>The 201 and 204 crossed the Atlantic immediately
as deck passengers on the <i>S. S. Enoree</i>, and
Lieut. Commander Barnes followed on the <i>S. S.
Housatonic</i>, with 205 and 208. The <i>Enoree</i> arrived
at Gibraltar first, on April 13th. Boats were in the
water the next day, and Lieut. Edwin A. Dubose&mdash;also
destined to make a name as a brilliant PT
sailor&mdash;took them to the British torpedo-boat
dock, loaded a full cargo of torpedoes, and set sail
for Oran in North Africa. Skippers of the other
boats followed as fast as longshoremen could
swing the PTs into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Disappointment awaited the crews in Oran,
where the high command sent the boats to Cherchel,
300 miles from the nearest action, for an indefinite
period of training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to take the bull by the horns and bum
a ride to Algiers in an Army truck to see Vice
Admiral Henry K. Hewitt,&rdquo; said Lieut. Commander
Barnes.</p>
<p>Admiral Hewitt was commander of all U. S.
Naval forces in northwest African waters, and
Barnes hoped to persuade him that the PTs should
be based at B&ocirc;ne, 265 miles farther east and
within easy reach of trouble at the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That trip took me several hours and by the time
I got there I was chagrined to find that orders had
already been issued and Lieut. Richard H. O&rsquo;Brien,
my next in command, had gotten the boats under
way and was in Algiers before me. The admiral
himself brought me up to date with the information
that my boats were already there. Most embarrassing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, April 27th, Lieut. Dubose took
his boats to the forward base at B&ocirc;ne, and that
night they went out on their first patrol in combat
waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p class="tb">B&ocirc;ne was also the British forward base for
motor torpedo boats and gunboats. Like the American
PTs, the British MTBs carried torpedoes, but
the British had already converted some patrol
craft to gunboats, similar to the heavily gunned PTs
of New Guinea. The gunboats carried no torpedoes.</p>
<p>The British had been fighting in the Mediterranean
for months, so American PTs made most of
their early patrols with British officers aboard to
tip them off to local conditions.</p>
<p>The North African campaign was drawing to
a close. General Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s crack Afrika
Korps was bottled up in Tunisia, and torpedo
boats patrolled nightly to prevent escape of Rommel&rsquo;s
soldiers to Sicily, just 90 miles across the
strait from Tunisia&rsquo;s Cape Bon.</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Barnes, in the 106, joined
three British torpedo boats under Lieut. Dennis
Germaine, in a patrol down the east side of
Cape Bon. At Ras Idda Bay, Lieut. Germaine
took one British MTB inside the harbor to investigate
a possible target.</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Barnes continues the story:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon Germaine came up on the radio
with the startling statement that there are lots of
ships in there, so I took the remaining British
boats with me and started in. It was as black as the
inside of your pocket, but sure enough, right there
in front of me was a ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time we saw it against the dark background
of the land we were inside the torpedo-aiming
range and had to go all the way around the
other side of it before getting a good shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking there were other targets around, I
lined up and fired only one torpedo&mdash;our first!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ran hot and straight, and after what seemed
like an interminable time made a beautiful hit forward.
The whole ship blew up in our faces, scattering
pieces of debris all around us and on deck.
Just like the movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We immediately started to look for other ships
but could find none. Neither could we find our
British friend, who, it turned out, was temporarily
aground, so we just eased around trying to
rendezvous. Pretty soon he found us&mdash;and
promptly fired two fish at us, one of which passed
right under our bow and the other under the stern,
much to our alarm and his subsequent embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half an hour later, bombers started working
over the airfield a couple of miles away, and
with the light of the flares we managed to join up
with Germaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I personally think that ship was aground&mdash;the
ship we torpedoed&mdash;although it certainly made a
fine spectacle going up, and one of our officers who
was along that night subsequently flew over the
area in a plane and reported it sitting nicely on the
bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, Germaine had not seen any ships and
had mistaken some peculiar rock formations for a
group of enemy vessels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>That was not the last mistake of the British
Navy. Unused to working with their new Allies,
the British boats took one more near-lethal crack
at American PTs.</p>
<p>Lieut. Dubose, in Lieut. (jg) Eugene S. Clifford&rsquo;s
212, with Lieut. Richard H. O&rsquo;Brien in 205, left
B&ocirc;ne on the night of May 10th to patrol Cape Bon.
On the way home after a dull night, the two boats
cut deep into the Gulf of Tunis to keep clear of a
British destroyer area.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Tunis was supposed to belong to
torpedo boats that night, but two British destroyers
came roaring out of the night on an opposite
course only 900 yards away. The destroyers
opened up with machine guns as they passed, so
the PTs fired two emergency recognition starshells
and ran away behind a smoke screen.</p>
<p>Two German E-boats, lurking in the darkness for
a crack at the two destroyers, opened up on the
PTs instead, and the British took <i>all</i> the torpedo
boats under fire, distributing shells and bullets on
American and German boats with impartiality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>The two PT skippers were given the thorny
tactical problem of dodging friendly destroyer
fire while simultaneously taking on the German
boats. Lieut. Clifford turned back through his own
smoke, surprised the E-boats at close range when
he burst out of the screen, and raked the enemy
with his machine-gun batteries. He ran back into
the smoke before they could swing their mounts to
bear on him, so he couldn&rsquo;t report results of his
attack, but destroyer sailors saw one of the E-boats
burst into flame. The other ran from the fight.</p>
<p>Not so the destroyers. They chased the PTs for
an hour, firing starshells and salvos from their main
battery. Fortunately their shooting was poor, and
the PTs got out of the battle with only a few
machine-gun holes.</p>
<p>Days later one of the destroyer skippers called
to apologize. &ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been able to find any
action in our assigned patrol area,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so we
decided to have a bit of a look in the PT area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The destroyer skipper&rsquo;s action was dashing and
bold, but it was also a fine way to catch a friendly
torpedo in his own ship or to kill a dozen or so of
his Allies.</p>
<p>Three E-boats had attacked the destroyers at
the precise instant that the American PTs arrived
on the scene, according to the British officer
who had heard a German radio discussion of a plan
to attack the destroyers. Naturally the alarmed
British began blasting at any torpedo boat in sight.
Everybody saw Dubose&rsquo;s recognition flares, but took
them for tracer fire, a common mistake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p class="tb">A strange aftermath of the running gun battle was
the naval occupation of the great port of Bizerte by
a lone PT.</p>
<p>The 205 lost the other boat in the night and put
into Bizerte for gasoline. The port had just been
taken by Allied troops a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>The shore batteries, now in friendly hands, nevertheless
fired the &ldquo;customary few rounds&rdquo; at the arriving
PT boat, but the imperturbable Lieut.
O&rsquo;Brien said: &ldquo;The shots were wide, so I continued
in and tied up at the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later a newsreel photographer asked
O&rsquo;Brien to move his PT out of the way so he could
photograph some British landing ships just arriving
as &ldquo;the first Allied craft to enter Bizerte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieut. O&rsquo;Brien wondered what his own boat was
if not an Allied craft, and he had been in Bizerte
long enough to be bored with the place, but he
patiently moved aside.</p>
<p>The brush-off from the newsreel man was only
the beginning of the stepchild treatment the PTs
suffered at Bizerte.</p>
<p>Squadron Fifteen cleaned up a hangar and
scrounged spare parts and machinery from all over
the city. When the big boys came into the harbor,
their skippers were delighted with the tidy
PT base and ruthlessly pushed the little boys out
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;We cleaned up half the buildings in Bizerte,&rdquo;
said one veteran of Squadron Fifteen. &ldquo;As fast
as we made a place presentable, we were kicked
out. We ended up with only a fraction of our
original space, and we had to fight tooth and nail
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in May the squadron was filled out to full
strength and the newly arrived boats were fitted
with radar. The British boats did not have it, so the
two torpedo-boat fleets began to experiment with
a system of radio signals to vector British boats to
American radar targets in coordinated simultaneous
attacks.</p>
<p class="tb">After the collapse of the Afrika Korps in Tunisia
in mid-May 1943, all of North Africa was in Allied
hands and Allied attention turned toward Europe,
across the narrow sea.</p>
<p>To mislead the enemy about the spot chosen by
the Allies for the next landing, British secret
agents of the Royal Navy elaborated a fantastic
hoax worthy of the cheapest dime novel. The
amazing thing is that it worked.</p>
<p>The British dressed the corpse of a man who
had died of pneumonia in the uniform of a major
in the Royal Marines. They stuffed his pockets with
forged credentials as a Major William Martin, and
they planted forged letters on the body to make
him look like a courier between the highest Allied
commands. The letters &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; that the Allies
would next land in Sardinia and Greece. The body
was pushed overboard from a submarine off the
coast of Spain. It washed up on the beach as an
apparent victim of a plane crash and was frisked
by an Axis agent, just as the British had hoped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Hitler was taken in by the hoax and gave priority
to reinforcing Sardinia and Greece, widely separated,
not only from each other, but also from
Sicily, where the Allies were actually going to
land.</p>
<p>To help along the confusion of Axis officers (most
of whom were of a less romantic nature than
their <i>Fuehrer</i> and were not taken in by the Major
William Martin fraud), the Allies mounted another
hoax almost as childishly imaginative as the
planted cadaver trick.</p>
<p>On D-Day, July 10, 1943, Commander Hunter
R. Robinson in PT 213 led a flotilla of ten Air
Force crash boats to Cape Granitola, at the far
western tip of Sicily, as far as it could get from
the true landing beaches around both sides of the
southeastern horn of the triangular island.</p>
<p>The crash boats and the PT were supposed to
charge about offshore during the early hours of
D-Day, sending out phony radio messages, firing
rockets, playing phonograph records of rattling anchor
chains and the clanking and chuffing of landing-craft
engines. The demonstration didn&rsquo;t seem
to fool anybody ashore, but the little craft tried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Most of Squadron Fifteen was busy elsewhere
on the morning of D-Day and narrowly missed
being butchered in one of those ghastly attacks from
friendly forces that were so dangerous to PT
boats.</p>
<p>One force of American soldiers was going ashore
at Licata. Twenty-four miles west, at Port Empedocle,
was a flotilla of Italian torpedo boats which
so worried the high command that Empedocle
had been ruled out as a possible landing beach. To
keep the Italian boats off the back of the main naval
force, a special screen was thrown between Port
Empedocle and the transport fleet, a screen of
seventeen of Lieut. Commander Barnes&rsquo; PTs and
the destroyer <i>Ordronaux</i>. After the war, historians
discovered that the much-feared Italian torpedo
boats at Empedocle had accidentally bumped
into the invasion fleet the night before the landings,
and had fled in panic to a new base at Trapani at
the farthest western tip of the island.</p>
<p>Another one of those terrible blind battles between
friendly forces was prepared when nobody
told the westernmost destroyers of the main
landing force that PTs would be operating nearby.
The skippers of the destroyers <i>Swanson</i> and <i>Roe</i>,
nervous anyway because of the Italian torpedo-boat
nest at Empedocle, charged into the PT patrol
area when they saw radar pips on their screens.
Lieut. Commander Barnes flashed a recognition
signal, but the destroyer signal crews ignored it.</p>

<p>Just as the destroyer unit commander was about
to open fire at 1,500 yards, Roe rammed Swanson
at the forward stack. <i>Roe&rsquo;s</i> bow folded up and
both ships went dead in the water. The <i>Swanson&rsquo;s</i>
forward fireroom was partly flooded. Both ships
had to be sent to the rear for repairs, carrying with
them, of course, their five-inch cannon which were
sorely missed by the assault troops of that morning&rsquo;s
landings.</p>
<p>Two nights later, on July 12th, Lieut. Commander
Barnes split his PTs into two forces to
escort twelve crash boats for another fraudulent
demonstration of strength at Cape Granitola. The
two forces ran parallel to the beach behind smoke,
and noisily imitated the din of a force a thousand
times their true size.</p>
<p>Searchlights blazed out from the shore, and the
second salvo from shore batteries landed so close to
the boats that the skippers hauled out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shore batteries were completely alerted,&rdquo;
said Lieut. Commander Barnes. &ldquo;Apparently the
enemy was convinced that a landing was about to
take place when it detected the &lsquo;large number&rsquo; of
boats in our group approaching the beach, for
they opened a heavy and accurate fire with radar
control.... I immediately reversed course and
opened the range. One shell damaged the rudder
of a crash boat and another fell ten yards astern of
a PT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demonstration was called a success and we
withdrew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The next day enemy newspapers reported that
an attempted landing on the southwest coast of
Sicily had been bloodily repulsed.</p>
<p class="tb">Soldiers of the American and British landing
forces swarmed over Sicily, taking Italian prisoners
by the hundreds. Some Americans were amused,
some depressed by the standard joke of many
surrendering Italian soldiers: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry for
me. I&rsquo;m going to America and you&rsquo;re staying in
Sicily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palermo, major city on the northwestern coast,
fell to the Allies on July 22nd, and the jaunty
boats of Squadron Fifteen were the first Allied
naval power to show the flag in the harbor. They
picked their way through the sunken hulks of fifty
ships. The dockside was a shambles. In a word,
Palermo was a typical PT advanced base.</p>
<p>The squadron moved up from Bizerte the same
day and began patrolling the Tyrrhenian Sea,
those waters boxed in by Sicily, Italy, Sardinia and
Corsica.</p>
<p>Isolated in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about thirty miles
north of Palermo, is the island of Ustica. On the
first Tyrrhenian patrol Lieut. Commander Barnes
led his boats toward Ustica to see what was going
on in those backwaters of the war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn we were off Ustica,&rdquo; the squadron
leader reports. &ldquo;First thing, we saw a fishing boat
putt-putting toward Italy. We found a handful of
very scared individuals crawling out from under
the floor plates, hopefully waving white handkerchiefs.
This was the staff of an Italian admiral at
Trapani [site of the Italian torpedo-boat base at the
western tip of Sicily, bypassed by the fall of Palermo].</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only reason we didn&rsquo;t get the admiral was
that he was late getting down to the dock and his
staff said the hell with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to a few souvenir pistols and
binoculars, we captured a whole fruit crate of
thousand-lira notes which we reluctantly turned
over to Army authorities later. One of the other
boats saw a raft with seven Germans on it, feebly
paddling out to sea. We picked them up too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The next night three PTs of Squadron Fifteen
patrolled to the Strait of Messina, right against the
toe of the Italian mainland itself, and two nights
later, off Cape Vaticano, the same three boats&mdash;under
Lieut. E. A. Arbuckle&mdash;found the 8,800-ton
Italian freighter <i>Viminale</i> being towed toward
Naples by a tug.</p>
<p>For some reason, the freighter was being towed
backward, almost causing the PT skippers to take
a lead in the wrong direction, but they sank both
ships in the first U.S. Naval victory in the Tyrrhenian
Sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>On the night of July 26th, near the island of
Stromboli, three PTs commanded by Lieut. J. B.
Mutty ran into their first F-lighters, those powerfully
armed German landing craft and general-duty
blockade runners that were to become the Number
One enemy of PTs in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The F-lighters were slow and cumbersome, but
they were armored and mounted extremely
heavy antiaircraft batteries which could saw a PT
into toothpicks. Gun turrets were lined with cement
and often mounted the much-feared 88-mm.
rifle, thus enormously outgunning the PTs.</p>
<p>Holds of the F-lighters were so well compartmented
that they could take terrible punishment
without going down. With only four and
one-half feet of draft, they usually slid over PT torpedoes,
set to run at eight-foot depth. An F-lighter
was a serious opponent for a destroyer and much
more than a match for a PT&mdash;in theory.</p>
<p>The three PT skippers at Stromboli didn&rsquo;t know
about that theory, however, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t
have hesitated about attacking even if they had
known how dangerous an F-lighter was. They fired
six fish and thought they had blown up two of the
F-lighters, but postwar assessment says No. Neither
side was badly hurt in this first duel, but more
serious fighting was to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The next night, July 28th, three boats commanded
by Lieut. Arbuckle fired at what the skippers
thought were F-lighters, but were really Italian
torpedo boats. American torpedoes passed harmlessly
under the hulls of the enemy boats;
Italian machine-gunners punched sixty holes in
PT 218 and seriously wounded three officers, including
Lieut. Arbuckle. The boat got back to
Palermo with 18 inches of water sloshing about below
decks.</p>
<p class="tb">The F-lighters were ferrying Axis troops out of
Sicily, across the Strait of Messina. The Allied
high command had hoped to catch the whole Axis
force on Sicily in a gigantic trap, and the Messina
ferry had to be broken up.</p>
<p>The Navy tried a combined torpedo boat-destroyer
operation against the ferry, but as usual,
communications between the American ships were
bad and the destroyers opened fire on their own
PTs.</p>
<p>The first salvo from the American destroyers
splashed water on the PT decks. The PTs were
five knots slower than the American cans. (Remember
those news stories, in the early days
of the war, about the dazzling 70-knot PTs&mdash;fast
enough to &ldquo;run rings around any warship afloat&rdquo;?
During the summer of 1943, few of the Squadron
Fifteen boats could top 25 to 27 knots.) Because
they couldn&rsquo;t run away from their deadly friends
and because they feared American gunnery more
than they feared Italian gunnery, the PT boats actually
ran for the enemy shore to snuggle under the
protection of Italian batteries on Cape Rasocolmo.
The enemy guns obligingly fired on the American
destroyers and drove them away. The PT sailors
went home, enormously grateful to the enemy
for his involuntary but effective act of good will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>In August the Axis powers ferried most of their
power to the mainland across the three-mile-wide
Strait of Messina, in a brilliant escape from the
Sicilian trap.</p>
<p>PT skippers knew about the evacuation, but had
orders to stay away from the scene. British torpedo
boats that tried to break up the evacuation
train were badly mauled by shore batteries. One
torpedo boat disappeared, with all hands, in the
flash of a direct hit from a gigantic nine and one-half-inch
shell.</p>
<p>Chafing at the order that kept it out of the
action, the PT command dreamed up an operation
to relieve the tedium. It decided to mount an invasion
of its own to capture an island.</p>
<p>Setting up a jury-rig invasion staff, the officers
pored over charts, looking for the ideal enemy island
to add to the PT bag. Lieut. Dubose, returning
from a fight with German mine sweepers on the
night of August 15th, picked up an Italian merchant
seaman from a small boat off Lipari Island,
in the Aeolian Group, a few miles northwest of
the Strait of Messina. The sailor said there were
no Germans on Lipari and the islanders would undoubtedly
be delighted to be captured by the
American Navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>When the admiral heard the squadron&rsquo;s proposal
he radioed: &ldquo;Demand the unconditional surrender
of the islands, suppress any opposition,
bring back as prisoners all who are out of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three PTs, their crews beefed up by 17 extra
sailors, six soldiers and a military government
man&mdash;with a destroyer following behind as main
fire support&mdash;sailed into Lipari Harbor at 11 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>
on August 17th, guns manned and trained on the
beach. At precisely the critical moment, the destroyer
hove into view around a headland, giving
the impression of a mighty fleet backing up the
puny invaders.</p>
<p>The commandant of the Italian naval garrison
came down to the dock himself to handle mooring
lines for his captors.</p>
<p>The American Military Government man
stepped gracefully ashore in the first assault wave
and set up a government on the spot. PT men
rounded up military prisoners, hauled down the
Italian and hoisted the American flag.</p>
<p>The Italian commodore slipped off in the excitement
and tried to burn his papers, but a sailor
persuaded him to stop by pressing the muzzle of
a 45 automatic to his brow.</p>
<p>Sailors confiscated the documents and collected
souvenirs, while the commandant radioed the
other islands in the group and the PT skippers
accepted their surrender by long distance. Only
Stromboli resisted, so the PTs chugged over to find
out what was holding up the breaking out of peace
on that volcanic pimple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They found an Italian chief petty officer and a
30-man detail, blowing up their radio equipment.
The American sailors indignantly halted the sabotage&mdash;then
destroyed the stuff themselves.</p>
<p>All the Italian navy saboteurs were put under
armed guard for transport to American prisons in
Sicily, but a pregnant woman burst into sobs,
pleading that one of the men was her husband, a
fisherman who had never spent a night away from
Stromboli in his life. Six other women joined
their wails to the chorus. The local priest assured
Lieut. Dubose that their stories were true, so
Dubose granted the prisoners a reprieve.</p>
<p>The boats returned to Lipari, picked up fifty
merry military prisoners there, and departed for
Palermo to the cheers of the entire town.</p>
<p>Messina fell that same day, and the Sicilian campaign
was over.</p>
<p class="tb">Three weeks after the fall of Sicily, on the
morning of September 9th, Allied troops went
ashore in force on the mainland around the magnificent
Bay of Salerno, just across a headland
from Naples, second port of Italy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Invasion chores were not strenuous for the PTs&mdash;a
little anti-E-boat patrol in the bay and
some light courier and taxi service for Army
and Navy brass. Dull duty, but the boats had to
fly low and slow, because they were almost out of
aviation gasoline; their tanker had failed to arrive
on schedule.</p>
<p>By October 4th, however, the gasoline was in and
the British had taken a splendid harbor at La Maddalena,
off northeast Sardinia, so Squadron Fifteen
sailed to Sardinia, from where it and the British
boats could prey on enemy traffic north of Naples.
Almost immediately, part of Squadron Fifteen
moved still farther north to Bastia, on Corsica,
which the Free French had just taken back from
the enemy. These two bases put PTs on the flanks
of coastal shipping lanes deep in the heart of
enemy waters. Genoa itself, the largest port in
Italy, was now within reach of the squadron&rsquo;s torpedoes.
Hunting was especially good in the Tuscan
Archipelago, a group of islets and rocks between
the PT base and the mainland.</p>
<p>Something had to be done about the PT torpedoes,
however, for the squadron was equipped
with old Mark VIIIs, built in the 1920&rsquo;s, crotchety,
unreliable, and worst of all, designed to run so
far below the surface that they couldn&rsquo;t touch a
shallow-draft F-lighter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>PT torpedomen tinkered with their fish to set
them for a shallow run, but the Mark VIII was
frisky without eight feet of water to hold it down.
The shallow-set Mark VIIIs porpoised, alternately
leaping from the water and diving like sportive
dolphins. PT skippers set them shallow anyhow,
and fired them with the idea that there was a
fifty-fifty chance the porpoising torpedo would be
on the upswing when it got to the target and might
at least punch a hole in the side.</p>
<p class="tb">In Italy, as the contending armies fought slowly
up the peninsula, the German situation became
somewhat like the Japanese situation at that same
moment in New Guinea. Powerful Allied air
strikes disrupted supply by rail from Genoa and
Rome to the front, so the Germans had to rely on
waterborne transport to run down the coast at
night.</p>
<p>To protect themselves from marauding Allied
destroyers, the Germans fenced off a channel close
to the shore with a barrier of thousands of underwater
mines. At salient points they mounted heavy,
radar-directed cannon&mdash;some as big as nine and
one-half inches in bore&mdash;to keep raiding destroyers
pushed away from the mine-protected channel.</p>
<p>The mine fields worked. Deep-draft destroyers
did not dare chase Axis vessels too close to the
beach. The shallow-bottom PTs skimmed over the
top of the mine fields, however, so the Germans
countered by arming many types of small ships
as anti-PT boats. They took over a type of Italian
warship called a torpedo boat, but actually a
small destroyer, fast and heavily gunned, eminently
qualified for PT-elimination work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Night patrols became lively, with PTs harrying
Axis coastal shipping and the Germans hunting
them with E-boats and armed minesweepers, torpedo
boats and F-lighters.</p>
<p>The first brawl after the PTs set up base on
Sardinia and Corsica came on the night between
October 22nd and 23rd. Three PTs, under the indefatigable
Lieut. Dubose, sneaked up on a cargo
ship escorted by four E-boats and minesweepers.
The PTs fired a silent spread of four, and the
cargo ship disappeared in a violent blast. Lieut.
(jg) T. L. Sinclair was lining up his 212 to work a
little more destruction, when a wobbly out-of-control
Mark VIII torpedo from another PT flashed
by under his stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many have you fired?&rdquo; Lieut. Dubose
asked Lieut. Sinclair by radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None yet. I&rsquo;m too damned busy dodging yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Between Giglio and Elba, in the Tuscan Archipelago,
on the night between November 2nd and
3rd, two PTs, under Lieut. Richard H. O&rsquo;Brien,
made a torpedo run on a subchaser and blew a
satisfactorily fatal hole in the hull with a solid hit.
The stricken vessel went down, all right, but it
went down fighting, and one of the last incendiary
bullets from the dying ship bored through the gasoline
tank of the 207, touching off an explosion that
blew off a deck hatch. Flames as high as the radar
mast shot through the open hatchway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>A radioman turned on a fire extinguisher, threw
it into the flaming compartment, and slammed
down the hatch again. Miraculously, the fire went
out.</p>
<p class="tb">Early in November, Lieut. Commander Barnes,
who had been doing some deep thinking about the
war against F-lighters, came up with a new tactical
idea.</p>
<p>His reasoning was: PTs are radar-equipped,
hence better than British boats at finding enemy
vessels and maneuvering for attack; British torpedo
boats use better torpedoes than American Mark
VIIIs, for they are faster and carry heavier explosive
charges; British gunboats have heavier firepower
than PTs, for they usually carry at least
six-pounder cannon and so can take on heavier opponents.</p>
<p>So Lieut. Commander Barnes and his British
counterpart worked out a scheme of joint patrolling,
the Americans acting as a scout force and
finding targets by radar. The targets once found,
the PTs were to guide the British boats in a coordinated
attack. From November 1943 until April
1944, joint patrols had fourteen actions, in which
skippers claimed 15 F-lighters, two E-boats, a tug
and an oil barge sunk; three F-lighters, a destroyer,
a trawler, and an E-boat damaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>As winter came on, winds mounted and seas ran
high, but the PTs maintained their patrols. On the
foul night of November 29th, Lieut. (jg) Eugene A.
Clifford took his 204 out with another PT for a
patrol near Genoa. Within two hours the wind built
up to 35 knots, water smashed over the bow in
blinding sheets and drowned out the radar, visibility
dropped to less than a hundred yards. The
PTs gave up the patrol and turned back toward
Bastia. In the stormy night the boats were separated
and the 204 plugged along alone, lookouts almost
blinded by the spray.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness four E-boats appeared
within slingshot range, laboring on an opposite
course. A fifth E-boat &ldquo;crossed the T,&rdquo; but not fast
enough, for the PT and the E-boat struck each other
a glancing blow with their bows.</p>
<p>From a ten-yard range, the two small craft
ripped into each other with every gun that would
bear. The other four E-boats joined the affray, and
for fifteen seconds the 204 was battered from broad-jumping
distance by the concentrated fire of five
enemy boats.</p>
<p>The PT escaped in the darkness and the crew
set about counting its wounds. Bullets had torn
up torpedo tubes, ventilators, ammunition lockers,
gun mounts. The deck and the superstructure were
a ruin of splinters. The engine room had a hundred
new and undesired ventilation apertures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The skipper polled his crew to prepare the
melancholy roll of dead and wounded. Not a man
had been nicked! The gas tank was intact. The
engines still purred along like electric clocks. The
204, outnumbered five to one, had stood up to a
fifteen-second eyeball-to-eyeball Donnybrook and
was nevertheless bringing all its sailors home in
good health.</p>
<p class="tb">Two of the squadron&rsquo;s PTs were detached in
January 1944, and went south again for duty in the
ill-fated Anzio landing. Lieut. General Mark Clark,
commanding the Fifth American Army, wanted the
boats for water-taxi duty between the main American
lines near Naples and the Anzio beachhead,
thirty miles south of Rome. Usually the taxi runs
were dull for sailors of the PT temperament, but
not always.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 28th, General Clark
and some of his staff boarded Lieut. (jg) George
Patterson&rsquo;s 201 at the mouth of the Volturno River,
and in company with 216 set sail for Anzio,
seventy-five miles to the north.</p>
<p>Twenty-five miles south of Anzio, the minesweeper
<i>Sway</i> patrolled the southern approaches
to the beachhead. The captain had just been warned
that enemy airplanes were attacking Anzio, and he
knew that the Germans often coordinated air and
E-boat strikes, so when he saw two small boats
ripping along at high speed and coming down
the sun&rsquo;s track, he challenged them by blinker light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Without reducing speed, Lieut. Patterson answered
with a six-inch light, too small a light for
that distance in the daylight. Besides, the signalmen
on the <i>Sway</i> were partly blinded by the glare
of the sun, just rising behind the 201.</p>
<p><i>Sway&rsquo;s</i> guns opened fire. Lieut. Patterson fired
an emergency recognition flare, but it burst directly
in the face of the sun, and the <i>Sway&rsquo;s</i> bridge crew
missed the second friendly signal from the torpedo
boat. The 201 even reduced speed as a further
friendly gesture, but the slower speed only made
the boat a better target.</p>
<p>The next shot hit the boat in the charthouse,
wounding Lieut. Patterson and his executive officer,
Ensign Paul B. Benson, and killing an officer passenger
and a sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the hell out of here,&rdquo; suggested General
Clark.</p>
<p>Ensign Benson, though wounded, took the wheel
from the sagging skipper and zigzagged the boat
away at high speed back toward Naples, until he
was out of range of the <i>Sway&rsquo;s</i> batteries. A few
miles down the coast the crew of 201 transferred
dead and wounded to a British minesweeper.</p>
<p>The <i>Sway</i> still stood between the boat and Anzio,
but General Clark wanted to go to the Anzio
beach, so the 201 crept back at a peaceful-looking
speed and spoke up from long distance with a
bigger light. The sun was higher, <i>Sway&rsquo;s</i> signalmen
read the message, and the skipper waved them by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p class="tb">Lieut. Commander Barnes still restlessly experimented
with armaments and tactics, looking for a
combination of weapons and methods that would
counter the dangerous weapons of the F-lighters.
Rocket launchers were being mounted on landing
craft, and the small vessels were delivering
devastating ripples on enemy beaches. Their firepower
was all out of proportion to the size of the
craft. A few PTs were playing around with rocket
launchers in the Pacific. It&rsquo;s worth at least a try,
thought Lieut. Commander Barnes.</p>
<p>On the night of February 18th, 1944, Barnes went
out in Lieut. (jg) Page H. Tullock&rsquo;s 211, with
Lieut. Robert B. Reader&rsquo;s 203 and Lieut. (jg) Robert
D. McLeod&rsquo;s 202.</p>
<p>As Lieut. Commander Barnes tells the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a small radar target come out from behind
the peninsula and head over toward one of
the small islands south of Giglio. Thinking it might
be an F-lighter, I ordered rocket racks loaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have seen us, because whatever it was&mdash;probably
an E-boat&mdash;speeded up and ducked
into the island before we could make contact.
That presented the first difficulty of a rocket installation.
There we were with the racks all loaded
and the safety pins out. The weather had picked up
a little, and getting those pins back in the rockets
and the racks unloaded was going to be a touchy
job in the pitch dark on wet, tossing decks. I decided
to leave them there for a while to see what
would happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;About midnight it started to kick up a good
deal more. I had just about decided that whatever
it was we were looking for wasn&rsquo;t going to
show up, and I was getting pretty worried about
the rockets heaving out of the racks and rolling
around in a semiarmed condition on deck.
I decided to take one last turn around our patrol
area and head for the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our last southerly leg we picked up a target
coming north at about eight knots, and I closed
right away, thinking to spend all our rockets on
whatever it was. As we got closer, it appeared to
be two small targets in column&mdash;a conclusion
which I later used as an outstanding example of
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trust your interpretation of radar too
blindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about the time we got to the 1,000-yard
firing range the lookouts started reporting vessels
everywhere, all the way from our port back around
to our starboard bow. I had arranged the other two
boats on either side in line abreast and ordered
them to stand by to fire on my order over the radio.
I gave the order and we all let go together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the eleven seconds the rockets were in
flight nobody fired a shot, but a couple of seconds
after the rockets landed what seemed like a dozen
enemy craft opened up. The formation was probably
three or four F-lighters escorted by two groups
of E-boats. We had passed through the two groups
of escorts on our way to our firing position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now it was time to turn away, and as my boat
turned to the right we found that the 202 was
steaming right into the convoy. To avoid collision
we had to turn back and parallel the 202.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at that time the engines on my boat
started to labor and unbelievably coughed and
died&mdash;all three of them. We were smack dab in
the center of the whole outfit, with the enemy
shooting from all sides.... The volume was
terrific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 203 had lost all electric power, including
the radar and compass lights. She saw the two of
us off our original course and came back to join us,
making a wide circle at high speed and laying
smoke. It is impossible to say exactly what happened;
the melee was too terrific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 202 had a jammed rudder which they were
able to clear. She eventually got out by ducking
around several vessels, passing as close as 100 yards.
The 203 likewise got out by ducking in and out of
the enemy formation, but we on the 211 just sat
there helpless, watching the whole show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This business lasted for at least four or five
minutes and even the shore batteries came into illuminate
with starshells. Fortunately, there was
enough smoke in the air to keep the issue confused.
That confusion was the only thing that saved us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of our boats was using guns at all, and it
was obvious that the enemy was frightfully confused
with us weaving through the formation. They
were hard at work shooting each other up. I am
sure they sank at least one of the E-boats, because
several minutes later they started firing again off
to the north, and there was a large gasoline fire in
the channel which burned for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got clear by the simple process of just
sitting still and letting the enemy pass around us
and continue north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally got one engine engaged and went to our
rendezvous which was only a couple of miles away,
but by the time I got there I could just see the
other two boats, on the radar screen, leaving. I
tried to call them back, but I couldn&rsquo;t get a soul
and waited around for some time thinking they
would come back. They didn&rsquo;t, however, and
went on back individually, for which they got a little
private hell from me later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no alternative but to go back myself. I
expected to find the other two boats pretty well
shot up, as it was a miracle that we weren&rsquo;t lost
ourselves. Strangely enough, I found that they were
not damaged, and except for the fantastic coincidence
of all three of us being more or less disabled
simultaneously, we were OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently, the rockets did no damage, and
further installation of rocket racks on his PTs was
firmly rejected by Lieut. Commander Barnes.</p>
<p>The American PT commander was not the only
one concerned about the heavy ordnance of the
F-lighters. Captain J. F. Stevens of the British
Navy&rsquo;s Coastal Forces in the Mediterranean said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;While coastal forces are the most suitable forces
to operate in mined areas, the enemy has so
strengthened his escorts and armed his shipping
that our coastal craft find themselves up against
considerably heavier metal. Furthermore, the enemy&rsquo;s
use of F-lighters of shallow draft does not
provide good torpedo targets. Everything that can
be done to improve our chances of successful attack
is being done. Torpedoes will, if possible, be fired
at even shallower settings. Meanwhile, if they cannot
achieve destruction, coastal forces will harry the
enemy and endeavour to cause him the utmost
possible alarm, damage, and casualties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officers at La Maddalena gave longer thought to
the problem and came up with an idea called
Operation Gun.</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Barnes&rsquo; combined operation&mdash;the
plan to use American radar for scouting and
conning heavier-armed British boats to targets&mdash;had
been a promising beginning, but even the MBG
gunboats were not a real match for the F-lighters.</p>
<p>Commander Robert A. Allan, British Commandant
of the Sardinia base, cut three landing craft
out of the British amphibious fleet and armed
them with 4.7 naval guns and 40-mm. autocannon.
The landing craft were big, flat-bottomed tubs,
wonderful platforms for the hard-hitting 4.7 inchers.
To man the guns, he assigned crack gunners of
the Royal Marine Artillery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Commander Allan organized an interesting task
force around the three landing-craft gunboats
(designated LCGs) as his main battle line. They
were screened against E-boat attack by British
torpedo boats, and controlled by the radar-equipped
American PT scouting force.</p>
<p>Commander Allan himself went out on the first
sweep of his beefed-up inshore patrol on the night
of March 27th. He rode Lieut. (jg) Thaddeus
Grundy&rsquo;s PT 218, so that he could use American
radar to assign targets to his gunboats and give
them opening salvo ranges and bearings by remote
control.</p>
<p>When the gunboat battle line arrived off San
Vicenzo, south of Leghorn, a scouting group of two
PTs, under Lieut. Dubose, went off on a fast
sweep, looking for targets. At 10 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> the PTs
had found six F-lighters going south, and Commander
Allan brought his main battle force up
quickly to intercept them.</p>
<p>At 11 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> Lieut. Dubose sharply warned the
main force that two destroyers were escorting the
lighters on the seaward side. &ldquo;I am preparing to
attack the destroyers,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Commander Allan continues the story: &ldquo;Until he
carried out this attack, it was not possible for us
to engage the convoy, as our starshells being
fired inshore over the target [to illuminate the
F-lighters for the gunboats] would illuminate us
for the escorting destroyers which were even farther
to seaward than we were. Fire was therefore
withheld during several anxious minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>During this ten-minute wait for the PT scouts to
take on the destroyers, both the German forces,
escort and convoy, came on Commander Allan&rsquo;s
radar screen.</p>
<p>The PT scouts crept to within 400 yards before
firing torpedoes, and ran away behind heavy smoke.
Nevertheless, the destroyers laid down such a
heavy fire that they hit 214, even in the smoke
screen, wounding the engineer of the watch,
Joseph F. Grossman, MoMM2c, and damaging the
center engine. Grossman ignored his wounds and
tended the stricken engine until it was running
well again, staying below with his engines until the
boat was out of danger.</p>
<p>The skippers of the scouting PTs heard the usual
large explosions on one of the destroyers and hoped
they had scored but couldn&rsquo;t be sure. Hit or no
hit, the destroyers reversed course and ran up the
coast, abandoning their convoy&mdash;an unthinkable
act of cowardice for Allied escorts.</p>
<p>Sunk or run off, it was all the same to Commander
Allan, who wanted only a free hand with
the F-lighters. When the destroyers were gone,
he passed radar ranges and bearings to the gunboats,
and the Royal Marines lit up the night
over the convoy with a perfect spread of starshells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Startled gunners on the F-lighters, unused to this
kind of treatment in waters where vessels with 4.7-inch
guns had never dared venture before, took the
lights for plane flares and fired wildly into the
clouds.</p>
<p>The Royal Marine gunners took their time for
careful aim under the bright glare of the slowly
sinking magnesium lights. At the first salvo, one of
the F-lighters blew up with a tremendous explosion.
Within ten minutes three F-lighters were burning
briskly. The gunboats spread out and pinned the
surviving boats against the beach while the Marine
artillerymen methodically pounded them to scrap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the six F-lighters destroyed,&rdquo; says Commander
Allan, &ldquo;two, judging by the impressive
explosions, were carrying petrol, two ammunition,
and one a mixed cargo of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With what sounds like a note of wistful disappointment,
Commander Allan added: &ldquo;The sixth
sank without exploding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Operation Gun Task Force sortied again
on the night of April 24th. The coastal waters
around the Tuscan Archipelago were swarming
with traffic that night. Early in the evening the gunboats
blew two F-lighters out of the water. Burning
debris, cascading from the sky after the
explosions, set fires on the beach.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward the Marine sharpshooters
picked off a tug and three more F-lighters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Radar picked up still another group and star-shell
from the gunboats showed that they were
three flak lighters&mdash;medium-size craft powerfully
armed as antiaircraft escorts for daylight convoys.
The Royal Marine gunners smacked their first
salvos into two of the flak lighters, which burned
in a fury of exploding ammunition.</p>
<p>The third lighter poured an astonishing volume of
fire at the unarmored gunboats, and Commander
Allan, in PT 218, made a fast run at the enemy
to draw fire away from his gunboats. The Marines
put a shell into the flak lighter, and it ran off behind
smoke, but the 209 led a charge through the
smoke, fired off its fish, caught the flak ship squarely
amidships, and blew it in two.</p>
<p>Lieut. Dubose&rsquo;s scouting torpedo boats found a
convoy escorted by a flak lighter, but at that moment
the gunboats were engaged in another fight,
so rather than break up the show of the main battle
line, the PTs attacked the enemy themselves. At
least one of three fish connected, for the flak
lighter blew up in a jarring explosion.</p>
<p>Ashore, fifty miles away at Bastia, squadron
mates sat outdoors to watch the flash and glare of
the all-night battle against the eastern sky. Things
were just threatening to get dull after midnight
when shore radio at Bastia called Commander
Allan with a radar-contact report of an Axis convoy
between the gunboats and Corsica. The PTs
got there first and found two destroyers and an
E-boat in column.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>When the PTs were still 2,500 yards away&mdash;too
far for a good torpedo shot from a small boat&mdash;the
destroyers fired a starshell. PT 202 was ready
for just that emergency. A sailor standing by
with a captured five-star recognition flare fired
the correct answering lights and calmed the enemy&rsquo;s
nerves.</p>
<p>The PTs moved in under the guise of friends and
fired four fish at 1,700 yards. As they ran away they
felt a violent underwater explosion, so they
claimed a possible hit.</p>
<p>On this one wild night of action Commander
Allan&rsquo;s strange little navy had, without damage to
itself, sunk five of the formidable F-lighters, four
heavily armed flak lighters, and a tug; scored a
possible torpedo hit on a destroyer; and pulled a
dozen German prisoners from the water.</p>
<p class="tb">Hearts of the PT sailors were lifted with joy in
May 1944, when the Mark XIII torpedoes began
to trickle into their bases and the heavy old-fashioned
torpedo tubes were replaced with light
launching racks that gave the boats badly needed
extra bursts of speed. More boats had been arriving,
too, and eventually there were three PT squadrons
working out of Sardinia and Corsica.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>As torpedomen installed the new fish and the
new launching rigs, a PT skipper rubbed his hands
and said: &ldquo;Wait till we get a good target now.
These Mark Thirteens are going to sweep these
waters clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieut. Eugene A. Clifford, in 204, led two other
PTs in the first attack with the new torpedoes on
the night of May 18th in the Tuscan Archipelago.
The PTs had two flak lighters on their radarscopes.
Determined to try out the new torpedoes,
they bored through the massive barrage from the
flak lighters&rsquo; antiaircraft guns, firing from 1,000
yards.</p>
<p>One of the highly vaunted Mark XIII&rsquo;s made a
typical Mark VIII run and hit the 204 in the stern.
Fortunately, when this Mark XIII goofed, it really
goofed, so it did not explode, but punched through
the PT&rsquo;s skin and lodged its warhead inside.
Its body dangled in the PT&rsquo;s wake, like a sucker-fish
clamped to a shark&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>Lewis H. Riggsby, TM2c, went into the lazaret
to stuff towels into the vanes of the impeller to
keep the torpedo from arming and exploding.</p>
<p>The flak lighters chased the PTs and hit 204
with 20-mm fire, but the boat escaped behind
smoke, one of the famous Mark XIII torpedoes
bobbing and dangling from the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p class="tb">Dominating the Tuscan Archipelago, within
sight of the Italian mainland, is the island of Elba,
first home of Napoleon in exile. The island attracted
the Allies, because big guns on the point
closest to the mainland could reach the coastal
road and also close off the inshore passage to
coastal craft. Once Elba was in Allied hands,
southbound Axis land traffic might be chased a few
miles inland to less-developed mountain roads,
and sea traffic would certainly be squeezed into
the thirty miles of water between two Allied
bases at Elba and Corsica.</p>
<p>One problem annoyed the planners of the Elba
landings. What to do for naval support? The waters
around Elba were probably the most heavily
mined on the Italian Coast, and deep-draft ships
could not be risked there. But then, hadn&rsquo;t PTs
been scooting about the coast of Elba for nine
months?</p>
<p>On the night between June 16th and 17th thirty-seven
PTs joined other shallow-draft vessels of the
Coastal Force to support landings of Senegalese
troops of the French Ninth Colonial Division,
plus mixed elements from other Allied forces.</p>
<p>Five PTs approached the northern coast at midnight,
and about a half mile from shore put 87
French raiders in the water in rubber rafts. The
five PTs joined another quintet at the farthest
northeast point of Elba, the point closest to the
mainland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>At 2 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> three of the ten PTs went roaring
along the northern coast, smoke generators wide
open and smoke pots dropping over the side in a
steady stream. When the shoreline was sealed off
behind a 16,000-yard curtain of smoke, four more
PTs moved down the seaward side, with loudspeakers
blaring the sounds of a great fleet of landing
craft. The PTs launched occasional ripples of
rockets at the beach to imitate a preinvasion
shore bombardment.</p>
<p>The three remaining PT skippers carried on a
lively radio exchange, straining their imaginations
to invent a torrent of orders for an imaginary invasion
armada.</p>
<p>Searchlights from the beach swept the water,
looking for a hole in the screen. Land guns on the
shore and in the mountains to the west poured
shells into the smoke screen, thus pinpointing
themselves nicely for an Allied air strike that
slipped in just before dawn.</p>
<p>At the true landing beach on the south coast,
Lieut. (jg) Eads Poitevent, Jr., captain of the 211,
was posted as radar picket to guide landing craft
ashore. He was alarmed when he saw a radar
target creep out of the harbor at Marina de Campo.
He could not attack without alerting the beach,
and yet the oncoming enemy vessel had to be kept
away from the landing flotilla at any cost.</p>
<p>Poitevent boldly sailed close to the target&mdash;an
E-boat&mdash;and made friendly looking signals on a
blinker light. He eased off in a direction away
from the convoy, luring the patrol into harmless
waters. It took him fifteen minutes to tease the
E-boat off the scene and return to his duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>The E-boat would not stay away, however, and
in its aimless wanderings it blundered across the
path of a PT with a deckload of British commandos
destined for a preinvasion landing. The
commandos slipped over the side, three-quarters
of a mile farther out than they had planned, and
silently paddled their rubber boats successfully
to the beach, around the lackadaisical enemy
patrol.</p>
<p>Another PT saw the E-boat also, and thinking
it was a friendly, tried to form up in column.
Lieut. (jg) Harold J. Nugent, on 210, who
was following the bumbling drama on radar, broke
radio silence just long enough to cheep the smallest
of warnings to his squadron mate. The E-boat
crew incredibly fumbled about those waters,
teeming with Allied boats, for most of the night
and never lost their happy belief that they were
alone with the stars and the sea.</p>
<p>PT radarscopes now showed a more interesting
target. Coming right up the patrol line was something
big, in fact, a formation of big ships, so PT
skippers prepared for a torpedo attack. They held
back, however, for full identification of the targets,
because the ships could just possibly be the invasion
flotilla, slightly off course.</p>
<p>At 400 yards, Nugent challenged the approaching
formation by blinker. The nearest vessel answered
correctly, and a few seconds later repeated
the correct code phrase for the period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Lieut. Nugent continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Being convinced that the ships were part of
the invasion convoy which had probably become
lost, I called to my executive officer, Lieut. (jg)
Joel W. Bloom, to be ready to look up the ships&rsquo;
correct position in our copy of the invasion plan. I
brought the 210 up to the starboard side of the
nearest ship, took off my helmet, put the megaphone
to my mouth and called over &lsquo;What ship are
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First there was a string of guttural words,
followed by a broadside from the ship&rsquo;s two
88-mm. guns and five or six 20-mm. guns. The
first blast carried the megaphone away and tore
the right side off a pair of binoculars that I was
wearing around my neck. It also tore through the
bridge of the boat, jamming the helm, knocking out
the bridge engine controls, and scoring a direct
hit on the three engine emergency cutout switches
which stopped the engines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I immediately gave the order to open fire, and
though we were dead in the water and had no
way of controlling the boat, she was in such a
position as to deliver a full broadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a few minutes of heavy fire, we had reduced
the firepower of the closest ship to one
wildly wavering 20-mm. and one 88-mm. cannon
which continued to fire over our heads throughout
the engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easy to identify the ships, as the scene
was well lighted with tracers. They were three
ships traveling in a close V, an E-boat in the
center with an F-lighter on either flank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were engaging the F-lighter on the starboard
flank of the formation. As the ships started
to move toward our stern the injured F-lighter
screened us from the fire of the other two ships,
so I gave the order to cease fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the ensuing silence we clearly heard screams
and cries from the F-lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two members of our engine-room crew, who
were topside as gun loaders during battle, were
sent to the engine room to take over the chief engineer&rsquo;s
duties, for I was sure he was dead or
wounded. However, he had been working on the engines
throughout the battle and had already found
the trouble. We immediately got under way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found out, however, that our rudder was
jammed in a dead-ahead position, but by great
good fortune we were headed directly away from
the enemy, so I dropped a couple of smoke pots
over the side and we moved off. The enemy shifted
its fire to the smoke pots, and we lay to and
started repairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much to our surprise, we found that none of us
had even been wounded, but the boat had absorbed
a great deal of punishment. A burst of 20 mm. had
zipped through the charthouse, torn the chart table
to bits, knocked out the lighting system, and de-tuned
and scarred the radio and radar. Another
burst had gone through the engine room, damaged
control panels, torn the hull. All hits, however,
were above the waterline. Turrets, turret lockers,
ventilators, and the deck were holed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We called the 209 alongside, and sent off a radio
report to the flagship on the action and the direction
in which the ships retired.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lieut. Nugent learned from the skipper of the
209 that his boat had been hit only twice, but one
of the shells had scored a direct hit on a 40-mm.
gun loader and killed him instantly.</p>
<p>The tall, black warriors from French Senegal
swept over the island in two days of brisk fighting
and Elba was Allied. The sea roads to the south
were blocked, and PT action shifted to the north,
to the Ligurian Sea, the Gulf of Genoa, and the
lovely blue waters off the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Azur.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The War in Europe:</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">English Channel</span></h2>
<p>In England, as May 1944 turned into June, it
didn&rsquo;t take a genius to know that something big
was afoot. Military traffic choked the roads leading
to the Channel seacoast and the coastal villages.
Troops were in battle dress, officers were grim
faced, all hands hustled about on the thousands of
mysterious errands that presage an offensive.
Everybody knew it was the Big Landing&mdash;the assault
on Fortress Europe&mdash;but where?</p>
<p>Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two, under
Lieut. Commander John Bulkeley (with only three
boats this was the smallest squadron ever organized),
had helped to make the decision where to
land. Assigned to the Office of Strategic Services&mdash;America&rsquo;s
cloak-and-dagger outfit for all kinds
of secret business&mdash;Squadron Two had run a
ferry service between England and the enemy-occupied
continent to deliver secret agents, saboteurs,
spies, resistance officers, and couriers for the governments
in exile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>The sailors of Squadron Two carried out their
orders, of course, but on some of their errands
they could mutter the old Navy adage: &ldquo;I may
have to take it, but I don&rsquo;t have to like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, the night they were sent across the
Channel to land on the Normandy shore, there to
scoop up several bucketfuls of sand. The crews
grumbled about taking their fragile craft under the
guns of Hitler&rsquo;s mighty Western Wall just to fill
the First Sea Lord&rsquo;s sandbox.</p>
<p>They did not find out, until long after that
night, why they were sent to play with shovels and
buckets on the Normandy beach. A scientist who
claimed to know the beaches well&mdash;beaches that
had already been picked for the Normandy landings&mdash;said
that they were made of spongy peat
covered with a thin layer of sand, and that Allied
trucks and tanks would bog down helplessly on the
soft strand, once they left the hard decks of the
landing craft.</p>
<p>The samples brought back by the PT sailors
proved that the scientist didn&rsquo;t know sand from
shinola about Normandy beach conditions, and the
operation went ahead as planned.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1944, the first waves of American
and British troops landed on Omaha and Utah
beaches and began the long slugging match with
Marshal Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Nazis to twist Normandy
out of German hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>During the landings proper, PTs were used as
anti-E-boat screens, but made their biggest contribution
by dousing flare floats dropped by German
aircraft to guide their night bombers.</p>
<p>At the beginning the assigned duties of the PTs
were not heavy, but there is always work for a fleet
of small, handy armed boats in a big amphibious
operation.</p>
<p>On June 8th, for instance, as the destroyer <i>Glennon</i>
jockeyed about off the Saint Marcouf Islands,
north of Utah Beach, getting ready to bombard a
shore battery, she struck a mine astern. One minesweeper
took the damaged destroyer under tow,
and another went ahead to sweep a clear escape
channel. Just before 9 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>, the destroyer-escort
<i>Rich</i> closed the ships, and the skipper asked if he
could help. The captain of the <i>Glennon</i> answered:
&ldquo;Negative; clear area cautiously, live mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too late. A heavy explosion stopped the <i>Rich</i>
dead in the water. A second explosion tore away
fifty feet of the stern. A third mine exploded forward.
The destroyer-escort was a shambles, its
keel broken and folded in a V. The superstructure
was festooned with a grisly drapery of bodies and
parts of bodies.</p>
<p>PTs rallied around the <i>Rich</i> to take survivors
from the deck or from the mine-filled waters
around the shattered vessel. Crewmen on the 508
saw a sailor bobbing by in the sea, and the bowman
picked up a heaving line to throw to his rescue.
The man in the water calmly refused assistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the line,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have no arms
to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PT skipper, Lieut. Calvin R. Whorton,
dove into the icy Channel waters, but the armless
sailor had gone to the bottom.</p>
<p>The <i>Rich</i> followed him in fifteen minutes, with
79 of the crew. Seventy-three survivors were
wounded.</p>
<p>The <i>Glennon</i> itself went aground, and two days
later a German shore battery put two salvos
aboard. The destroyer rolled over and sank.</p>
<p class="tb">American soldiers ashore pushed rapidly northwestward
along the coast of the Cherbourg Peninsula,
to capture the port of Cherbourg, sorely
needed as a terminal to replace the temporary
harbor behind a jury-rig breakwater of sunken ships
at the landing beaches. The Nazi garrison at Cherbourg
put up a last-ditch stand, however, and on
June 27th, forts on the outer breakwater and a few
coastal batteries still held out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>The Navy sent a curiously composed task force
to reduce the forts. With the destroyer <i>Shubrick</i>,
the Navy sent six PTs to deal with the holdout Germans.
It is hard to understand what PTs were expected
to accomplish against heavy guns behind
concrete casemates. Perhaps the reputation of
the PT commander had overpowered the judgment
of the Navy brass, for it was none other than Lieut.
Commander John Bulkeley, hero of the MacArthur
rescue run and the New Guinea blockade, come to
try his mettle in European waters.</p>
<p>Leaving four PTs with the destroyer as a
screen, Bulkeley, in 510, with 521 in company,
cruised by the forts and sprayed them with machine
guns at 150-yard range. The stubborn Nazis
poured out a stream of 88-mm. shells and hit 521
hard enough to stop her dead for five minutes while
a motor machinist mate made frantic repairs.
Lieut. Commander Bulkeley ran rings around the
stalled craft, laying a doughnut of smoke around
her for a screen.</p>
<p>The <i>Shubrick</i> herself was taking near misses from
shore batteries, so the skipper recalled the PTs
and departed the scene. The two &ldquo;bombardment&rdquo;
PTs followed suit, having accomplished little except
to exercise the crew. Fortunately no American
sailors were hurt in this most inappropriate use
of PT capabilities.</p>
<p class="tb">Even after the Allies had taken the whole Normandy
coast, the Germans clung to the offshore
Channel Islands of Jersey, Alderney, Guernsey,
and Sark. On Jersey, they maintained a base for
small craft which made annoying nightly sorties.</p>
<p>To seal off the Jersey base, the Navy ordered PT
Squadrons Thirty and Thirty-four to patrol nightly
from Cherbourg to the Channel Islands in the company
of a destroyer escort for backstop firepower
and for radar scouting.</p>

<p>On the night between August 8th and 9th, the
<i>Maloy</i> and five PTs were patrolling west of Jersey.
The weather was good all night, but shortly before
dawn a thick fog settled over the sea. At 5:30 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>
the radar watch on the <i>Maloy</i> picked up six German
minesweepers.</p>
<p>Lieut. H. J. Sherertz, as the officer in tactical
command of the PT patrol, was riding <i>Maloy</i>
to use its superior radar. He dispatched three PTs
from the northern end of the scouting line to attack
the Germans. The skipper of PT 500, one
of the north scout group, was Lieut. Douglas
Kennedy, now editor of <i>True</i> magazine. Blinded
by the peasouper, the PTs fired torpedoes by
radar, but missed.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, Lieut. Sherertz vectored
the southern pair of torpedo boats to the attack.
The 508 and 509 approached the firing line through
the fog at almost 50 knots. Lieut. Harry M. Crist, a
veteran of many PT battles in Pacific waters and
skipper of 509, risked one fish by radar aim from
500 yards. Lieut. Whorton (the officer who had
tried in vain to save the armless sailor of the <i>Rich</i>)
couldn&rsquo;t fire, because his radar conked out at the
critical moment, so the PTs circled and Lieut.
Crist conned the 508 by radio. The boats fired but
missed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>As they came about to circle again, Whorton reported
that he heard heavy firing break out between
the other PT and a minesweeper, but he
couldn&rsquo;t shoot because his buddies were between
him and the Germans. Whorton lost the 509
in the swirling fog, and when he came around
again, everybody had disappeared. He searched
almost an hour and returned to the <i>Maloy</i> on orders
of Lieut. Sherertz, because his burned-out radar
made his search ineffective.</p>
<p>The 503 and the 507 took up the search for their
missing comrades. At 8 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> they picked up a
radar target in the St. Helier roadstead at Jersey,
and closed to 200 yards. The fog lifted briefly
and unveiled a minesweeper dead ahead and on a
collision course. The 503 fired a torpedo, and
both boats raked the enemy&rsquo;s decks, but suffered
hard punishment themselves from the enemy&rsquo;s return
fire. Before the boats escaped from the
enemy waters, two PT sailors were killed and
four wounded on 503, and one wounded on 507.</p>
<p>The next day a search plane found the body of
a sailor from the 509, and ten days later a bullet-riddled
section of the hull was found floating in the
Channel. It was not until after the war that the
fate of the 509 was learned from the sole survivor,
a liberated prisoner of war named John L. Page,
RdM3c. Here is his story:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;After firing one torpedo by radar, the 509
circled and came in for a gunnery run. I was in the
charthouse on the radar. Lieut. (jg) John K. Pavlis
was at the wheel. I remember we were moving
fast and got pretty close before receiving return
fire. When it came it was heavy and accurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shell burst in the charthouse, knocking me
out. When I came to, I was trying to beat out
flames with my hands. I was wounded and the boat
was on fire, but I pulled the detonator switch to
destroy the radar and then crawled on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bow of our boat was hung up on the side
of a 180-foot minesweeper. From the deck of
the enemy sweeper, Germans were pouring in
small-arms fire and grenades. Everything aft of
the cockpit was burning. I struggled forward
through the bullets and bursting grenades to the
bow&mdash;I have no idea how long that journey took&mdash;and
the Germans tossed me a line. I had just
enough strength to take it and they hauled me
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Germans stretched Page out on the deck
and attacked the PT&rsquo;s carcass with crowbars,
frantically trying to pry themselves loose from its
clutches. Just as the PT broke loose, it exploded
with a tremendous roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; says Page, &ldquo;but I felt the
heat and the blast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Free of the PT, the minesweeper ran for the
shelter of home base at St. Helier. The Germans
carried Page back to the crew&rsquo;s quarters to tend
his wounds. He had a broken right arm and leg,
thirty-seven bullet and shrapnel holes in his body,
and a large-caliber slug in his lungs. While they
were working on him they were carrying in their
own dead and wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed to count the dead. There were fifteen
of them and a good number of wounded. It&rsquo;s
difficult to estimate how many, because they kept
milling around. I guess I conked out for a while.
The first thing I remember is a first-aid man
putting a pack on my back and arm. Then I could
hear the noise of the ship docking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After they removed their dead and wounded,
they took me ashore at St. Helier. They laid me
out on the dock for quite a while, and a couple of
civilians&mdash;I found out later they were Gestapo
agents&mdash;tried to question me, but they saw I was
badly shot up, so they didn&rsquo;t try to question me
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page was taken to a former English hospital
at St. Helier, where skillful German surgeons performed
many operations&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t remember
how many&mdash;to remove dozens of bullets and
fragments from every part of his body. The final
operation was on December 27, 1944.</p>
<p>While he was in the hospital, the bodies of three
of his shipmates washed ashore on Jersey. The
British Red Cross took over the bodies and buried
them with military honors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Page was regularly annoyed by Gestapo men,
but he said: &ldquo;I found that being very correct and
stressing the fact that my government didn&rsquo;t permit
me to answer was very effective. They tried
a few times and finally let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page was liberated on May 8, 1945.</p>
<p>The Channel Island battles were vicious and inconclusive,
in a sense, but the German gadflies
stayed more and more in port&mdash;became more and
more timid when they did patrol. Nightly
sweeps of the PT-destroyer escort teams bottled
up the German boats and cleared the Channel
waters for the heavy traffic serving the voracious
appetite of the armies on the continent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">8.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The War in Europe:</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">Azure Coast</span></h2>
<p>After Allied troops had chopped out a good
firm foothold on the northwestern coast of
France, the Allied Command found that the Channel
ports were not enough to handle the immense
reserve of men and materials waiting in America
to be thrown into the European battle. Another
port was needed, preferably one on the German
flank in order to give the enemy another problem
to fret about.</p>
<p>Marseilles was the choice, with the naval base at
Toulon to be taken in the same operation. The Allies
set H-hour for 8 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> on August 15, 1944, and
assembled their Mediterranean naval power in Italian
ports. Among the destroyers assigned to the
shore fire-support flotilla were ships of the Free
Polish and Free Greek fleets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Lieut. Commander Stanley Barnes, when he heard
about these new comrades in arms, paraded his
PTs past the Greek destroyer in daylight so that
the Hellenic sailors could see what an American
torpedo boat looked like. With a strong sense of
history, Barnes remembered the Battle of Salamis,
and he didn&rsquo;t want the Greeks to mistake his boats
for Persians.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the first duty for the PTs was
to be mistaken for what they were not.</p>
<p>With two British gunboats, a fighter director
ship and three slow, heavily armed motor launches,
PTs of Squadron Twenty-Two sailed from Corsica
on August 14th, bound for the coast of France.
This task unit was under the command of Lieut.
Commander Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., the American
movie star.</p>
<p>Three of the PTs were detached to sail for the
northwest as an anti-E-boat patrol. Four others
took 70 French commandos northwest to land at
the Pointe des Deux Fr&egrave;res, in the beautiful Gulf
of Napoule that washes the beach at Cannes. (The
French commandos ran into a mine field ashore,
were strafed by friendly planes, and captured by
the Germans.)</p>
<p>The rest of the task unit sailed straight north,
as though headed for Genoa, trailing balloons as
radar targets, with the hope that the enemy would
think a big invasion force was bound for the Italian
seaport.</p>
<p>At Genoa, the phony flotilla turned west for the
waters off Cannes and Nice, still trailing its radar
target balloons. The launches and PTs maneuvered
off Antibes, making as much of an uproar as possible,
while the British gunboats bombarded the
beach.</p>

<p>The minuscule fleet was delighted to hear from
Radio Berlin that a massive Allied landing near
Cannes had been pushed into the sea with heavy
losses, and that Antibes and Nice had been bombarded
by four large battleships.</p>
<p>Captain Henry C. Johnson, commanding the
diversion groups, said: &ldquo;The decoy screen proved
effective as in addition to several enemy salvos
falling short of or bursting in the air over the gunboats,
the PTs and the launches were subjected
to a considerable degree of large-caliber fire which
passed well over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy with the confusion they had sown, the
eastern diversion group sailed west to join a western
task unit with a similar mission.</p>
<p>Off the Baie de la Ciotat, between Marseilles
and the port of Toulon, the eastern group joined
company with four more launches, 11 crash boats,
and eight PTs of Squadron Twenty-Nine, under
the control of the destroyer <i>Endicott</i>. Skipper of
the destroyer was a sailor who might be expected
to know a bit about a PT&rsquo;s capabilities. His name
was Lieut. Commander John Bulkeley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The armed motor launches and the destroyer
bombarded the beach behind a screen of PTs. The
crash boats trailed balloons, laid smoke screens,
fired ripples of rockets at the beach, laid delayed-action
bombs in shallow water to imitate frogmen
at work, and broadcast noises of many landing
craft. The crash boats hoped to give the impression
of a convoy ten miles long and eight miles
wide.</p>
<p>At 4 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> troop-carrier planes flew over the
town of La Ciotat and dropped 300 booby-trapped
dummy paratroopers.</p>
<p>Radio Berlin broadcast an alarm. &ldquo;The Allies
are landing forces west of Toulon and east of
Cannes. Thousands of enemy paratroops are being
dropped in areas northwest of Toulon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great bitterness, five hours later, Radio
Berlin broadcast: &ldquo;These paratroops were found
later to be only dummies which had booby traps
attached and which subsequently killed scores of
innocent civilians. This deception could only have
been conceived in the sinister Anglo-Saxon mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This complaint came from the nation that was
the world&rsquo;s acknowledged master at the nasty and
unmanly art of booby-trappery.</p>
<p>Radio Berlin continued: &ldquo;Large assault forces
have attempted to breach defenses west of Toulon,
but as the first waves have been wiped out by
mine fields, the rest lost heart and withdrew and
returned to an area in the east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two more nights the deception forces shelled
the beach and made noises like a mighty host.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>For two days the Germans announced that the
main Allied intention was to take Toulon and
Marseilles by direct assault, and talked of driving
off an invasion force including five battleships.</p>
<p>Before sailing away after the last phony demonstration,
Lieut. Commander Bulkeley broadcast a
message, saying that the landings at La Ciotat
would be postponed for a few days &ldquo;because of
the furious resistance on the beach,&rdquo; but that they
would definitely come. The Germans reinforced
the La Ciotat area with mobile artillery and infantry
units, sorely needed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Radio Berlin, after the final demonstration, said:
&ldquo;An additional and futile attempt of the American
forces to land large bodies of troops west of
Toulon has failed miserably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haw Haw, the English traitor who broadcast
for the Axis, said: &ldquo;The assault convoy was
twelve miles long, but for the second time in three
nights the Allies have learned of the determined
resistance of the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, to their cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Axis broadcasts had the unexpected result
of terrifying crews of German warships ordered
out to attack the &ldquo;invasion fleet.&rdquo; Prisoners of war
later reported that some of the ships would not
sail because they had lost heart after listening to
their own broadcast alarms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Some ships did venture out, however, for one of
the crash boats, retiring from the demonstration
area after the final show, ran into two enemy
corvettes&mdash;heavily armed escort vessels. The crash
boat called loudly for help, and two antique
British river gunboats, the <i>Aphis</i> and the <i>Scarab</i>,
came running. The British and German ships battled
for twenty minutes. Lieut. Commander Bulkeley&rsquo;s
<i>Endicott</i>, already almost out of sight on the
southern horizon, steamed back at flank speed and
opened fire at seven and one-half-mile range. Fire
was slow, however, for the <i>Endicott</i>, trying to
imitate a large bombardment force earlier that
night, had shot its five-inchers so fast that all but
one breech block was fused from the heat. The one
remaining gun shifted fire from one corvette to
the other.</p>
<p>Two PTs, screening the destroyer, closed the
corvettes to 300 yards and fired two fish, but
missed. The <i>Endicott</i> also fired torpedoes, and
the corvettes turned bow on to comb their tracks,
thus masking their own broadside. The <i>Endicott</i>
closed to 1,500 yards and raked the corvette decks
with 20-mm. and 40-mm. autocannon, driving gunners
from their stations.</p>
<p>The British gunboats and the destroyer pounded
the now silent corvettes until they sank. The ships
and PT boats picked up 211 prisoners from the
<i>Nimet Allah</i>, a converted Egyptian yacht, and the
<i>Capriolo</i>, a smartly rigged light warship taken
from the Italian navy.</p>
<p class="tb">In southern waters the PTs had been immune to
mines, but off the Mediterranean shores of France
they suffered terribly from a new type of underwater
menace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Following standard PT practice of moving the
base as close to the fighting front as possible,
Lieut. Commander Barnes set up a boat pool in
the Baie de Briande, near Saint Tropez, almost
as soon as the troops went ashore. The boats were
close to the fighting and ready for action, but their
gas tanker didn&rsquo;t show up. By the evening of
August 16th the boats were low on fuel, so the
skippers puttered about the coast, running down
rumors of gas tankers anchored here and there.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Wesley Gallagher in 202, and Lieut.
Robert Dearth in 218, set sail together to look for a
tanker reported to be in the Gulf of Fr&eacute;jus, fifteen
miles to the northeast, the other side of Saint Tropez.
At 11 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span>, as the boats were rounding the
point of St. Aygulf to enter the harbor at Fr&eacute;jus, the
bow lookout on 202 sang out that he saw a boxlike
object floating 150 yards dead ahead. The skipper
turned out to sea to avoid it.</p>
<p>During the turn a mine tore the stern off the
boat, blew stunned sailors into the water, and
threw a column of water, smoke, and splinters
hundreds of feet into the air. Four sailors jumped
overboard to rescue their shipmates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Lieut. Dearth brought the 218 over to pick up the
swimming sailors and tried to approach the floating
section of the 202 to take off survivors, but the
stern of his boat was blown off in the stunning explosion
of another mine.</p>
<p>The two skippers abandoned the shattered hulks
of their boats. In the life rafts they held a muster.
One man was missing and six men were wounded.
Amazingly, the engineers of the watch on both boats
survived, though they had been stationed right
over blasts so powerful that heavy storage batteries
had whizzed by them to land on the forecastle.</p>
<p>The sailors paddled shoreward. German planes
were raiding the beach at that moment, and shrapnel
from the antiaircraft barrage rained down on the
rafts.</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight, the sailors landed on a
rocky point chosen by the skippers because it looked
least likely to be land mined. Lieut. Gallagher
picked his way through a barbed-wire barricade
along the beach and found a deserted and partly
destroyed fisherman&rsquo;s cottage where the sailors lay
low for the rest of the night, not knowing whether
they had landed in friendly or enemy territory.</p>
<p>Soon after dawn the skippers made a tentative
venture into the open. Half a mile from the cottage
they ran into soldiers&mdash;American soldiers&mdash;who
took over the wounded men and guided the
other sailors to a Navy beachmaster who gave
them a boat ride back to their base.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p class="tb">A week later, on August 24th, task-force commander
Rear Admiral L. A. Davidson heard that
the Port-de-Bouc in the Gulf of Fos, west of
Marseilles and at the mouth of the Rhone Delta,
had been captured by the French Underground.
He ordered minesweepers to clear the gulf, and he
sent Capitaine de Fr&eacute;gate M. J. B. Bataille, French
naval liaison officer on his staff, to scout the shore
around the harbor. Capt. Bataille rode to the
gulf in Lieut. Bayard Walker&rsquo;s ill-fated PT 555.</p>
<p>The boat passed the minesweepers and came
close aboard an American destroyer whose skipper
notified Lieut. Walker that coastal shore batteries
were still shooting near the mouth of the Gulf of
Fos.</p>
<p>Lieut. Bayard reported: &ldquo;It was decided that
we could enter the Gulf of Fos, despite fire from
enemy coastal batteries, since we presented such a
small target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So&mdash;as he put it&mdash;they &ldquo;entered the bay cautiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One wonders how you go about entering a mine-filled
bay, by an enemy shore battery, &ldquo;cautiously.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The crew saw the French flag flying in a
dozen places on the beach, and landed at Port-de-Bouc
where they were welcomed by a cheering
crowd, waving little French flags. Capt. Bataille
met a fellow officer, French Navy Lieut. Granry,
who had parachuted into the area several weeks
before, in civilian clothes, and had organized a resistance
cell to prevent demolition of the port
when the Germans retreated. After a pleasant
half-hour ashore, gathering information (Lieut.
Walker spoke excellent French), the party re-embarked,
set a two-man watch on the bow, and
headed for sea at 29 knots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few minutes later,&rdquo; said Lieut. Walker, &ldquo;a
terrific blast exploded beneath our stern, carrying
away the 40-mm. gun and the gun crew and almost
everything else up to the forward bulkhead of the
engine room.... The four torpedoes were immediately
jettisoned and we anchored with two anchors
from separate lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Volunteers manned the life rafts to pick up the
men in the water. They returned with a body, one
uninjured sailor, and a man with a broken leg. Four
other sailors were never found.</p>
<p>One of the rafts could not return to the boat because
of strong currents, so Lieut. Stanley Livingston,
a powerful swimmer, swam the 300 yards,
towing the bitter end of a line patched together of
all available manila, electric cable, halyards, and
odds and ends, buoyed at intervals with life jackets.
Sailors on the boat then pulled the raft alongside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>A French pilot boat and a fisherman in an
open boat came out from the beach to help.
Overhead, fighter planes, attracted by the explosion,
took in the situation and set up an impromptu
umbrella.</p>
<p>The sailor with the broken leg needed help.
Lieut. Walker put him and the dead sailor&rsquo;s body
into the fisherman&rsquo;s boat with the pharmacist&rsquo;s
mate, and climbed in himself, as interpreter. They
shoved off for Port-de-Bouc.</p>
<p>One hundred yards from the PT boat, Walker
saw in the water a green line with green floats
spaced every foot. He yelled a warning at the
fisherman, but too late. A violent explosion lifted
the boat in the air and threw the four men into the
water.</p>
<p>Lieut. Walker came up under the boat and had to
fight himself free of the sinking craft. He took
stock. The dead sailor had disappeared forever.
The pharmacist&rsquo;s mate, about sixty feet away,
was shouting that he couldn&rsquo;t swim, so Walker
went to the rescue. The injured man was hauled
up to the bottom of the overturned boat where,
in Walker&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;He appeared to be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ordinary non-PT man might consider a perch
on the bottom of an overturned and sinking fishing
boat as being somewhat short of &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;
for a man with an unset broken leg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;The situation seemed so good,&rdquo; continued Lieut.
Walker in the same happy vein, &ldquo;that I decided
not to take off my pistol and belt.... The
French pilot boat came to our rescue, and the injured
man was put aboard without further harm.
The fishermen&rsquo;s boat upended and sank as the
last man let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker confessed to a tiny twinge of disappointment
at this point in his narrative. A scouting
float plane from the cruiser <i>Philadelphia</i> had
landed near the shattered boat, and the PT officers
had hoped to get off their message to the task-force
commander, but the pilot took fright when
the second mine went off under the fishing boat,
and he left for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had two narrow escapes getting back to the
PT boat,&rdquo; Lieut. Walker said. &ldquo;I requested the
pilot, Ensign Moneglia of the French Navy, to go
between two sets of lines I could see, rather than
back down and turn around as the majority seemed
to wish. It proved to be the safe way between two
mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew jettisoned all topside weights except
one twin 50-caliber mount, so that they would have
some protection against air attack.</p>
<p>Captain Bataille and Lieut. Livingston set out in
a rubber boat for the town of Carro, at the eastern
entrance of the Gulf of Fos, about five miles
away. They were frantic to complete their mission
by sending a message to the task-force commander,
and they hoped to find an Army message
center to relay their report that Port-de-Bouc was
in French hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Two teams of bucket brigades bailed out the
leaking hulk, but the water gained on them steadily.
At midnight the sailors jettisoned the radar and
brought up confidential publications in a lead-weighted
sack, ready to be heaved over if they
had to abandon the boat. The off-duty bucket
brigade had to share a few blankets, because the
night was chilly.</p>
<p>About an hour after sunrise Captain Bataille
and Lieut. Livingston returned from Carro in a
fishing boat, followed by another. That brought the
little flotilla to two pilot boats, two fishing boats,
and a battered piece of a PT. The two message-bearers
had been unable to find an Army radio.</p>
<p>Two of the boats passed lines to the PT to tow
it ashore, and the other two went ahead with
Captain Bataille and Lieut. Livingston in the bows,
as lookouts for moored mines. They found so many
on the road to Port-de-Bouc that the flotilla
turned and headed for Carro, on Cape Couronne,
instead.</p>
<p>At the Carro dock, the PT settled to the bottom.
An abandoned house beside the dock was
turned over to the homeless sailors, and the
French Underground trotted up five Italian prisoners
to do the dirty work of making the place
presentable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Best news in Carro was that the cruiser <i>Philadelphia</i>
had just sent an officer ashore with a radio,
to send out some news of possible targets along
the shore. Lieut. Walker tracked down his colleague,
and after bloody travail, finally sent off his
message to the task-force commander that Port-de-Bouc
was indeed in friendly hands, but that the
harbor waters were still acting in a very unfriendly
manner indeed.</p>
<p>Walker threw in a little bonus of the fact that
3,000 enemy troops were only a few kilometers
away and that the French Underground fighters
were afraid they might escape via Martigues.
He relayed the resistance officer&rsquo;s plea for an air
strike to break up the escape attempt long enough
for American troops to arrive and sweep up the
Germans.</p>
<p>Lieut. Walker adds a touching finale to his report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had asked the pastor of the Catholic church at
La Couronne, a village slightly more than a mile
from Carro, to say a Mass on Sunday morning for
the five men we had lost. A High Mass was celebrated
in the church, crowded to the doors, at 10:30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pastor and local people had gone to considerable
trouble to decorate the church with
French and American flags and flowers. The choir
sang, despite the broken organ, and the <i>cur&eacute;</i> gave
a moving sermon in French. Four FFI [Underground]
men, gotten up in a uniform of French
helmets, blue shirts, and white trousers, stood as
a guard of honor before symbolical coffins draped
with American flags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;After Mass our men fell in ranks behind a platoon
of FFI, and followed by the whole town,
we marched to the World War I monument.
There a little ceremony was held and a wreath
was placed in honor of the five American sailors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were told that a collection was in the process
of being taken up amongst the local people,
in order to have a plaque made for the monument
planned for their own dead in this war. The
plaque will bear the names of the five Americans
who gave their lives here for the liberation of
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people of La Couronne did not forget. In
that tiny village, on the lonely coast at the mouth
of the Rhone River, is a monument with a plaque
reading: <span class="sc">To Our Allies, Ralph W. Bangert,
Thomas F. Devaney, John J. Dunleavy, Harold
R. Guest, Victor Sippin</span>.</p>
<p class="tb">One of the most brilliant Anglo-American teams
was Lieut. R. A. Nagle&rsquo;s 559 and the British MTB
423, both under command of the dashing British
Lieut. A. C. Blomfield.</p>
<p>During the night of August 24th, the marauding
pair entered the harbor of Genoa to raise a bit of
general hell. Off Pegli, about five miles from
Genoa, they sighted what they thought was a destroyer,
and put a torpedo into it. The vessel was
only a harbor-defense craft, but a fair exchange for
the one torpedo it cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Two nights later the pair jumped a convoy of
three armed barges, and sank two of them. For the
next nine nights they tangled almost hourly with
F-lighters (four sunk), armed barges (eight sunk),
and even a full-grown corvette, the UJ 2216,
formerly the French <i>l&rsquo;Incomprise</i>, which they
riddled and sent to the bottom as the top prize of
their 11-day spree.</p>
<p class="tb">Hunting got progressively meager as winter came
on. PTs prowled farther afield and closer inshore
in a ferocious search for targets. On November
17th, Lieut. B. W. Creelman&rsquo;s PT 311 pressed the
search too far, hit a mine, and sank. Killed were
the skipper and his executive officer and eight of
the 13-man crew.</p>
<p class="tb">The last big fight of the American PTs with
enemy surface craft came two nights later when
Lieut. (jg) Charles H. Murphy&rsquo;s 308 and two
British torpedo boats sank a thousand-ton German
corvette, the UJ 2207, formerly the French <i>Cap
Nord</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>The naval war was nearing its end for the
Germans, and they turned to strange devices&mdash;human
torpedoes, remote-control explosive boats,
and semisuicide explosive boats. The remote-control
craft didn&rsquo;t work any better for the Germans
than they had for Americans in the Normandy landings.
So it was, also, with the human torpedo.</p>
<p>Lieut. Edwin Dubose, on PT 206, on September
10th, spotted a human torpedo in the waters off
the French-Italian frontier. The PT sank the torpedo
and pulled the pilot from the water. With
great insouciance, the pilot chatted with his rescuers
and treacherously told them where to find
and kill a comrade piloting another torpedo.</p>
<p>In those waters that same day, planes, PTs
and bigger ships sank ten human torpedoes.</p>
<p class="tb">As naval resistance lessened, the Western Naval
Task Force, under American Rear Admiral H. K.
Hewitt, was broken up and redistributed. Many
PTs were assigned to the Flank Force, Mediterranean.
Since most of the ships in the force
were French, the PTs came under the command
of French Contre-Amiral Jaujard.</p>
<p>Because Mark XIIIs were arriving in good numbers&mdash;the
torpedo targets were getting scarce&mdash;the
French admiral authorized the PTs in his command
to fire their old and unlamented Mark VIIIs
into enemy harbors.</p>
<p>On the night of March 21st, PTs 310 and 312
fired four Mark VIIIs, from two miles, into the
harbor of Savona, Italy. Three exploded on the
beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>The same boats, on April 4th, fired four at the
resort town of San Remo. Two exploded, one of
them with such a crash that it jarred the boats far
out to sea.</p>
<p>On April 11th, the 313 and the 305 fired four into
Vado, touching off one large explosion and four
smaller ones.</p>
<p>The last three Mark VIIIs were fired from the
302 and the 305 on April 19th. Lieut. Commander
R. J. Dressling, the squadron leader, launched
them into Imperia where a single boom was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these torpedoings of the harbors,&rdquo; said
Dressling, &ldquo;Italian partisans were rising against
the Germans, and there is little doubt that the explosions
of our torpedoes were taken by the enemy
as sabotage attempts by the partisans. At no time
were we fired on, despite the fact that we were
well inside the range of enemy shore batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieut. Commander Dressling thought that &ldquo;to a
small extent the actions assisted the partisans in
taking over the Italian ports on April 27th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night after the Italian ports all fell to the
Italian Underground, Admiral Jaujard, with a fine
Gallic sense of the ceremonial, led his entire Flank
Force, including PT Squadron Twenty-two, in a
stately sweep of the Riviera coast. It was partly
the last combat patrol and partly a victory parade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p class="tb">Ten days later, on May 8th, the Germans surrendered
and the war was over&mdash;the war was
over in Europe, that is, for on the other side of the
world the PTs were involved in the bitterest fighting
yet.</p>
<p class="tb">PTs had operated in the Mediterranean for two
years. The three squadrons lost four boats, five
officers and 19 men killed in action, seven officers
and 28 men wounded in action. They fired 354
torpedoes and claimed 38 vessels sunk, totaling
23,700 tons, and 49 damaged, totaling 22,600 tons.
In joint patrols with the British they claimed 15
vessels sunk and 17 damaged.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3">Round Trip by PT</span></h2>
<p>With the whole of New Guinea and the island
base at Morotai in Allied hands, the Philippine
Islands were within reach of Allied fighter
planes and it was time for General MacArthur to
make good his promise.</p>
<p>There was a lot of mopping up to do around
Morotai, however, because the taking of the island
had been a typical MacArthur leapfrog job. Morotai
was a small and lightly defended island, but twelve
miles away was the big island of Halmahera, defended
by 40,000 Japanese. MacArthur had jumped
over it to continue his successful New Guinea
policy of seizing bases between the Japanese and
their home, then isolating the by-passed garrison
with a naval blockade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The best way to bottle up the Halmahera garrison
was to call on the PT veterans of the New
Guinea blockade, so the day after the landings
on Morotai, September 16, 1944, the tenders
<i>Oyster Bay</i> and <i>Mobjack</i>, with the boats of Squadrons
Ten, Twelve, Eighteen, and Thirty-three,
dropped anchor in Morotai roadstead. The first
adventure of the Morotai PTs was the rescue, on
the very day of their arrival, of a wounded Navy
fighter pilot. (A full account of this is given at the
end of [Chapter 5].)</p>
<p>PT sailors sometimes wondered what the Stone
Age people of Halmahera, people who fought with
barbed ironwood spears, made of the strange war
being fought in their waters by the white and yellow
intruders from the twentieth century. Lieut.
(jg) Roger M. Jones, skipper of PT 163, tells about
an encounter that has probably entered the mythology
of these pagan people.</p>
<p>In October 1944, Lieut. Jones&rsquo;s boat and the 171
left Morotai for a routine patrol to keep the bypassed
Japanese of Halmahera from crossing to
Morotai. In the six weeks since the landings, PTs
had already sunk fifty Japanese barges, schooners,
and luggers carrying troops and supplies.</p>
<p>During the New Guinea campaign, as the use
of torpedoes shriveled for lack of suitable targets,
the 163 had mounted an awesome battery of ten
50-caliber machine guns in twin mounts, two 20-mm.,
a 37-mm., a 40-mm. autocannon, and a 60-mm.
mortar.</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s problem was simple. Intelligence
had told the PT skippers that there would be no
friendlies in the patrol area on the west coast of
Halmahera&mdash;no friendlies at all. &ldquo;Shoot anything
that moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To make a coordinated attack, the two PTs hardly
needed to communicate. They had gone through the
motions so many times that they performed the
maneuver like a reflex. The drill was to close a
radar target slowly and silently to 200 yards, fire
a mortar flare, and open fire with every gun
that would bear instantly as the flare burst to
smother the surprised Japanese before they could
answer.</p>
<p>That split-second timing, the business of opening
fire simultaneously with the bursting of the star-shell,
was drilled into gunners repeatedly by
dummy attacks on floating logs.</p>
<p>Twenty-five miles short of the patrol area, the
radar man found a target five miles off the beach.
The two skippers were jubilant; here was a target
made to order&mdash;too far out to sea to run for the
beach, out of the range of protecting shore batteries,
in water deep enough for a high-speed strafing run
by the PTs, with no chance of hitting a rock. The
boats went to general quarters and closed the target.</p>
<p>Lieut. Jones took the unnecessary precaution of
warning his gunners. &ldquo;Look alive, now&mdash;open fire
the <i>instant</i> the flare goes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At 200 yards the skippers could make out a dim
shape, but details of the target were hidden in the
darkness. Lieut. Jones gave a last warning to gunners
to be quick on the trigger, and fired his flare.
Twenty-four gun barrels swung to bear on target.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The flare burst.</p>
<p>Lieut. Jones continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was the perfect target, a Jap barge loaded
with troops&mdash;you could see their heads sticking up
over the gunwale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Open fire! Open fire!</i> I screamed in my mind,
but no words came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter? Why weren&rsquo;t the guns
firing? Thousands of tracers should be pouring into
that enemy craft, but no gun on either PT fired. The
flare died and I ordered another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was I doing this? Why wasn&rsquo;t the barge
sinking now, holed by hundreds of shells? Why
hadn&rsquo;t the gunners opened fire as ordered when the
flare went off? And what was the matter on the
Jap barge? Why weren&rsquo;t they tearing us up with
their guns, for the flare lit us up as brightly as it
illuminated them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We closed to 75 yards, still frozen in that strange
paralysis under the glare of the dying starshell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My helmsman spoke up. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re not Japs, sir,
they&rsquo;re natives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flipped on the searchlight, and our two boats
circled the canoe, searchlights blazing, guns trained.
That eerie scene will remain in my memory as long
as I live. Thirty natives&mdash;some of them boys&mdash;sat
rigidly still, staring forward unblinkingly. I
don&rsquo;t know if it was native discipline or sheer
terror that held them. Even the children didn&rsquo;t blink
an eye or twitch a finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shouted to them that we were Americans,
but we gave up trying to get through to them, for
they refused to answer or even to turn their heads
and look at us. We left them rigidly motionless
and staring straight ahead at nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back at the base we discussed our strange paralysis.
Everybody agreed he had first thought it was
a Jap barge when the flare burst, and nobody could
give a reason for not shooting instantly. If even one
gunner had fired, the whole weight of our broadside
would have come down on that canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never understand it, but we are all grateful
to Whoever or Whatever it was that held our
hands that night and spared those poor natives. And
what woolly stories those Halmaherans must be
telling their children about that night. I&rsquo;ll bet by
now we are part of the sacred tribal legends of
the whole Moluccan Archipelago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Almost from the beginning of the return trip to
the Philippines two years before, General MacArthur
had had his eye on Mindanao, the southernmost
large island of the group and hence the closest
to Morotai. It was on Mindanao that he planned to
land first, and from there he could advance up the
island chain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Before daring to venture into the Philippines,
however, the Allied High Command wanted to
make more landings&mdash;one at Yap Island, northeast
of Palau (where Marines had landed the same day
as the Morotai invasion), and another at Talaud
Island, another steppingstone, about halfway between
Morotai and Mindanao.</p>
<p>While the Palau and Morotai landings were going
on&mdash;indeed a few days before they started, but
too late to stop them&mdash;Admiral Halsey made a
bold proposal to cancel all intermediate landings
and take the biggest jump of all, completely over
Talaud, over Yap, even over Mindanao itself, all
the way to Leyte in the Central Philippines.</p>
<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff of all the Allies, then
at a conference in Quebec, swiftly accepted the
recommendation and set October 20th as target
date, chopping two months (and nobody will ever
know how many casualties) off the life of the Pacific
war.</p>
<p>In a wild flurry of activity, planners concentrated
the preparations of three months into a month, diverted
the forces for the other landings into Leyte
force, and made bold carrier strikes at Formosa,
in preparation for the landings in the Central
Philippines.</p>
<p>An example of the incurable tendency of high-level
Japanese officers to believe in their own foolish
propaganda is the fact that on the very eve of the
Leyte landings the Japanese defenders of the Philippines
relaxed their guard, because they thought
the Third Fleet had been wiped out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>American carriers had been roving the waters
off Formosa during the week before the landings,
and carrier planes had chewed up enemy airpower.
Japanese Intelligence officers, however, believed
the fantasies told them by their pilots returning
from attacks on the American fleet. Radio Tokyo
solemnly announced that the Third Fleet had
been annihilated with the loss of 11 carriers, two
battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer.</p>
<p>The Japanese public went wild with enthusiasm.
The Emperor made a special announcement
of felicitation to his people, and victory celebrations
were held at army and navy headquarters in the
Philippines.</p>
<p>The Third Fleet had actually suffered two
cruisers damaged.</p>
<p class="tb">The first American troops&mdash;a scouting force&mdash;landed
on October 17th on Dinegat and Suluan
islands, across the gulf from Leyte. Minesweepers
swept the gulf and frogmen poked about the shoreline.
Bombardment ships pounded the beaches,
and carrier planes blasted enemy airfields. Ships
of the attack landing forces entered Leyte Gulf
during the night of October 19th, and next morning
troops went ashore on four beaches on the west
side of Leyte Gulf and on both sides of Panoan
Strait, to the south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>PTs were rushed up from New Guinea, 1,200
miles away. Forty-five of the boats, under the tactical
command of Lieut. Commander Robert Leeson,
made the trip on their own power with a stop-over
for rest of a sort in Palau and a refueling at
sea, so as to arrive with enough gas to start patrols
immediately. They arrived in the combat zone
on the morning of October 21st, and began prowling
that same night.</p>
<p>Times were lively in Surigao Strait, and the PTs
had good hunting, but nothing compared to what
was coming.</p>
<p class="tb">Since a series of stinging setbacks from America&rsquo;s
carrier planes during operations in the Central
Pacific, the main body of the Japanese fleet&mdash;still
a formidable host&mdash;had held back from fighting
American ships in strength. Landings in the Philippines
were too much to put up with, however&mdash;too
close to the beloved homeland; His Imperial
Japanese Majesty&rsquo;s ships had to fight now, no matter
how desperate the situation&mdash;or rather because
the situation <i>was</i> so desperate.</p>
<p>The Japanese executed a plan long held in readiness
for just this event&mdash;the <i>Sho</i> plan, or Plan of
Victory, as it was hopefully called, though the
Japanese navy&rsquo;s chief of staff more realistically
called it &ldquo;Our last line of home defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stage was set for the greatest naval battle
of all time, the Battle of Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p>The naval lineup on the eve of battle&mdash;greatly
simplified, perhaps oversimplified&mdash;was as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">U. S. Navy</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Seventh Fleet</i>, under Vice-Admiral Thomas
Kincaid:</p>
<p>This slow but powerful force included six over-age
battleships, 18 small, slow escort carriers,
five heavy cruisers, six light cruisers, 86 destroyers,
25 destroyer escorts, 11 frigates, and the
usual gunboats, supply train and landing craft
for an amphibious operation&mdash;plus all the PTs
on the scene, the 45 veterans of the New Guinea
blockade. Mission of the Seventh Fleet was close
support of the Sixth Army landing force.</p>
<p><i>Third Fleet</i>, under Admiral William Halsey:</p>
<p>This fast and mighty force had six new fast
battleships, 16 fast carriers, six heavy cruisers,
nine light cruisers and 58 destroyers. Mission of
the Third Fleet was to prowl the waters north
of the landings on the lookout for a chance to
destroy once and for all the main Japanese battle
fleet, especially its remaining carriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Japanese Navy</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Northern Decoy Force</i>, under Vice-Admiral
Ozawa:</p>
<p>Four fat carriers, prime targets for the aggressive
Halsey, were screened by eight destroyers
and one light cruiser. Mission of the force was
suicidal. Without enough planes to make a serious
fight, Admiral Ozawa nevertheless hoped to lure
Halsey&rsquo;s powerful Third Fleet away from the landing
beach, thus exposing American transports to
attack by two powerful Japanese surface striking
forces that were to sneak into Leyte Gulf through
the back door, or rather two back doors at San
Bernardino and Surigao Straits, north and south
of Leyte Island.</p>
<p><i>Central Striking Force</i>, under Vice-Admiral
Kurita:</p>
<p>Five battleships, ten heavy cruisers, two light
cruisers and 15 destroyers. Admiral Kurita was
to take this formidable surface fleet through San
Bernardino Straits, at the northern tip of Samar,
to come down on the transports &ldquo;like a wolf on
the fold&rdquo; while Halsey&rsquo;s force was wasting time
on the sacrificial carrier decoy in the north.</p>
<p><i>Southern Striking Force</i>, under Vice-Admiral
Shima:</p>
<p>Formed of two task units&mdash;a vanguard under
Admiral Nishima of two battleships, one heavy
cruiser and four destroyers, plus a second
section under Admiral Shima of two heavy
cruisers, one light cruiser and four destroyers.
These two southern forces were to come up from
the East Indies and pass through Surigao Straits&mdash;happy
hunting grounds of the PTs&mdash;to join
with the Central Striking Force in Leyte Gulf
for the unopposed and leisurely destruction of
the Sixth Army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Japanese apparently could not believe
that the U.S. Navy&mdash;once Halsey had been suckered
into chasing off after the decoy carriers&mdash;had
enough ships left afloat to resist the two striking
forces. Had not the entire Japanese nation just celebrated
an Imperial proclamation of the near annihilation
of the American fleet?</p>
<p>All three Japanese forces converged on the Philippines
simultaneously. By October 24th, the three
forces had been spotted and reported by Allied
scouts. Torpedoes and bombs from planes and
submarines had made punishing hits on the advancing
Central and Southern Striking Forces, but
the ships kept plodding on toward the straits
north and south of Leyte.</p>
<p>And Admiral Halsey snapped at the bait dangled
by Admiral Ozuma&rsquo;s carriers. For a man of Admiral
Halsey&rsquo;s temperament, the reported sighting
of the northern carrier group was too much to
resist. He lit out to get them all&mdash;leaving unguarded
the Strait of San Bernardino, back gate into
Leyte Gulf and the transport area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>For once, an American command staff had
fallen into the chronic error of the Japanese. Admiral
Halsey apparently believed the exaggerated
claims of his pilots and thought that the Central
Striking Force had been decimated and the remnants
driven off. The Japanese had actually lost
only three cruisers to submarines and a battleship
to aircraft. After a short retreat, Admiral Kurita
reconsidered and turned back during the night
to resume the transit of San Bernardino Strait.
His powerful fleet was steaming toward the transport
area at 20 knots.</p>
<p>Admiral Kincaid misinterpreted a message from
Admiral Halsey and thought a part of his Third
Fleet was still on station, corking up San Bernardino,
so Kincaid dismissed the central force from
his mind and turned his attention to the southern
force heading for Surigao Strait. Not even a scout
submarine was watching the northern pass into
Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p>Shortly after noon of October 24th, Admiral
Kincaid notified his entire command to prepare
for a battle that night. He cleared Surigao Strait
of all unnecessary traffic, and gave Rear Admiral
Jesse Oldendorf the job of not only stopping but
destroying the enemy column.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Admiral Oldendorf had been commanding the
bombardment and support forces, and had in his
control all the heavy guns of the Seventh Fleet.
In a phrase which infuriated the Japanese when
they heard it, Oldendorf said that he deployed
his forces according to the professional gambler&rsquo;s
code: &ldquo;Never give a sucker a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surigao Strait is a narrow strip of water about
thirty-five miles long, running almost north-south
between Leyte and Dinegat islands. By its shape
and location, the strait was going to force the
Southern Striking Force to approach Leyte Gulf in
a long, narrow column. Admiral Oldendorf deployed
his ancient but still hard-punching battleships
in a line across the mouth of the strait where
it opens into Leyte Gulf. Thus, without further
maneuver, Oldendorf was certain to open fire
with his battle line already crossing the T of the
Japanese column. His fleet could swing its entire
broadside to bear simultaneously; the enemy could
fire only the forward turrets on the lead ship.</p>
<p>Admiral Oldendorf was not satisfied with depending
entirely on this setup, murderous as it
was, so he deployed every other fighting ship in his
command to work maximum destruction on the
Japanese. He posted cruisers and destroyers between
the battleships and the mouth of the straits,
as a combined screen and supplementary battle
line. Other destroyer squadrons were posted near
the strait, so that they could launch torpedoes and
then get out of the way during the gunfire phase
of the battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Admiral Oldendorf&rsquo;s position was good&mdash;except
for one thing. The warships had fired off most
of their ammunition in beach bombardment, and
magazine stocks were low, especially in the armor-piercing
shells needed for fighting heavy battleships.
Oldendorf ordered the battleships to hold their fire
until they were sure of making hits&mdash;and he
ordered maximum use of torpedoes.</p>
<p>That meant torpedo boats, so 39 of Commander
Selman Bowling&rsquo;s PTs were deployed in 13 sections
of three boats each along the shores of Surigao
Strait, and also along the coasts of Mindanao and
Bohol islands, far into the Mindanao Sea on the
other end of Surigao Strait. The farthest PTs were
stationed 100 miles from the battleline.</p>
<p>The Seventh Fleet had no night scouting planes,
so Admiral Oldendorf informed the PTs that
their primary mission was scouting. The boats
were to patrol the approaches to the strait and to
hide along the wooded shores fringing the coming
scene of battle. They were to relay radio contact
reports as the Japanese passed their station.</p>
<p><i>Then</i> they were to attack and do all the torpedo
damage possible before the Japanese came within
gunshot of the Seventh Fleet battleline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>The PTs took up their stations during the night,
and all hands topside peered out to sea, watching
for the telltale white bow wave of the first Japanese
ship.</p>
<p>The torpedo boat actions that followed are often
hard to understand. PTs, by the nature of their
attack, provoke wild melees, and survivors of melees
rarely remember precisely what happened.
What they do claim to remember is usually faulty
and contradicted by circumstantial evidence. PT
skippers kept only sketchy logs, and those entries
giving the time an action took place are often especially
inaccurate. As nearly as a historian can tell,
however, here is what happened to the PTs.</p>
<p>At 10:15 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> Ensign Peter B. Gadd, skipper of
PT 131, on station 18 miles south of Bohol Island
almost exactly in the middle of the Mindanao
Sea and 100 miles from Admiral Oldendorf, picked
up two targets on his radar screen. They were between
the three-boat section commanded by Lieut.
W. C. Pullen, and Bohol Island to the north. Lieut.
Pullen tried to reach Admiral Oldendorf by radio,
but failed, so he led the PTs 152, 130 and 131, in
a torpedo approach.</p>
<p>The radar pips broke into five separate targets,
and when a light haze lifted, the skippers clearly
saw what they thought were two battleships, two
cruisers and a destroyer. The enemy opened fire
at three-mile range, with his biggest batteries.
Starshells burst overhead and the PTs tore away
through a ghastly glare that made them feel naked
under the rain of high explosive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>An eight-inch shell hit a torpedo of 130 smack
on the warhead and tore through the bow. Miraculously,
there was no explosion.</p>
<p>The 152 was hit by a 4.7-incher, probably from a
destroyer that was closing fast, with searchlight
blazing. (This destroyer, the <i>Shigure</i>, was the only
ship of the Japanese van to survive the coming
massacre.) The explosion tore away the 37-mm.
cannon, killed the gunner, stunned the loader, and
wounded three sailors. The boat was afire.</p>
<p>Aboard the stricken 152, Lieut. (jg) Joseph Eddins
dumped two shallow-set depth charges into
his wake and pumped 40-mm. shells at the pursuing
destroyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our 40 mm. made the enemy reluctant to continue
the use of the searchlight,&rdquo; said Lieut Eddins.</p>
<p>The destroyer snapped off the light and sheered
away from the geysers of exploding depth charges.</p>
<p>The fight had lasted 23 minutes. Now there were
two more targets on the radar screen and the PT
sailors were frantic to get their radio report through
to the waiting battleline.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Ian D. Malcolm of 130 ran south until
he found Lieut. (jg) John A. Cady&rsquo;s section near
Camiguin Island. He boarded PT 127 and borrowed
its radio. Just after midnight on October 25th, Lieut.
Malcolm made the first contact report of the position,
course, and speed of the enemy. It was the
first word of the enemy received by Admiral Oldendorf
in fourteen hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Aboard the 152, the crew put out the fire, and
the skipper gave the boat a little test run. The
bow was stove in, but the plucky boat could still
make 24 knots, so Lieut. Pullen ordered a stern
chase of the disappearing Japanese. He had to
abandon the attack, however, because the Japanese
were too fast for him to catch. There is
something touching and ludicrous in the picture
of the tiny, bashed-up PT trying to catch the mammoth
Japanese battleline.</p>
<p class="tb">Lieut. (jg) Dwight H. Owen, in charge of a
section near Limasawa Island next picked up signs
of the approaching fleet. He tells how it looked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prologue began just before midnight. Off to
the southwest over the horizon we saw distant
flashes of gunfire, starshells bursting and far-off
sweep of searchlights. The display continued about
fifteen minutes, then blacked out. Squalls came and
went. One moment the moon shone bright as day,
and the next you couldn&rsquo;t make out the bow of your
boat. Then the radar developed the sort of pips you
read about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieut. Owen jumped for the radio, but the
enemy was jamming the circuit and he could not
get his report off. He did the next best thing&mdash;he
attacked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>At 1,800 yards, the cruiser <i>Mogami</i> snapped
on its searchlight and probed for the boats. PT 146
(Ensign B. M. Grosscup), and 150 (Ensign J. M.
Ladd), fired one fish each, but missed. The destroyer
<i>Yumagumo</i> caught the 151 and the 190 in
a searchlight beam, but the boats raked the destroyer
with 40-mm. fire and knocked out the
lights. The boats zigzagged away behind smoke.</p>
<p>Admiral Nishimura, commanding this van force
of the two-section Southern Striking Force, was
delighted with himself at this point, and sent a message
to Admiral Shima, congratulating himself on
having sunk several torpedo boats.</p>
<p class="tb">At the southern entrance to Surigao Strait, Lieut.
Commander Robert Leeson, on PT 134, commanded
the section posted on the western shore. The boat
crews saw flashes of the battle with Lieut. Owen&rsquo;s
boats, and half an hour later picked up radar pips
ten miles away. Leeson promptly passed the radar
sighting to Admiral Oldendorf, and then&mdash;the
milder duty done&mdash;led a torpedo attack.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Edmund F. Wakelin&rsquo;s 134 was caught
by a searchlight while still 3,000 yards from the
two battleships. Shells fell close aboard on both
sides, splashing water over the boat, and shrapnel
from air bursts banged against the deck, but the
skipper bore in another 500 yards to launch his
fish. The boat escaped from the Japanese and hid
in the shadow of Panaon Island, where later in
the night the sailors fumed helplessly as four Japanese
ships steamed, &ldquo;fat, dumb, and happy,&rdquo; past
their empty torpedo tubes at 1,000-yard range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>All the torpedo tubes of the section were not
empty, however, for Lieut. (jg) I. M. Kovar, in
137, at 3:55 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>, picked up an enemy formation
at the southern end of the strait and attacked. He
had no way of knowing it, but this was Admiral
Shima&rsquo;s second section, coming up to the relief of
Admiral Nishimura&rsquo;s van that had already entered
the strait, and indeed had at that very moment
been shattered by a vicious American destroyer-torpedo
attack.</p>
<p>Lieut. Kovar crept up on a Japanese destroyer,
maneuvering to take station at the rear of the enemy
column. He let fly at the can and had the incredible
good luck to miss his target entirely and smack a
light cruiser he hadn&rsquo;t even seen. Aboard the cruiser
<i>Abukuma</i>, the explosion killed thirty sailors, destroyed
the radio shack and slowed the cruiser to
ten knots, forcing it to fall out of formation.</p>
<p>The crippled <i>Abukuma</i> was caught and polished
off by Army bombers the next day. It was the only
victim of Army aviation in this battle and the only
positively verified victim of PT torpedoes, though
there is some evidence that a PT may have made
one of the hits claimed by American destroyers.</p>
<p>The rest of Admiral Shima&rsquo;s formation sailed
majestically up the strait, fired a spread of torpedoes
at two small islands it mistook for American
warships, and managed somehow to collide with
the fiercely burning cruiser <i>Mogami</i>, only survivor&mdash;except
for the destroyer <i>Shigure</i>&mdash;of the vanguard&rsquo;s
slaughter by the torpedoes and guns of the
Seventh Fleet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Gathering in the two surviving ships, Admiral
Shima led a retreat down the strait. At the moment
<i>Shigure</i> joined the formation, Lieut. C. T.
Gleason&rsquo;s section attacked, and the Japanese destroyer,
which was doing some remarkably able
shooting, hit Ensign L. E. Thomas&rsquo; 321.</p>
<p>Most sorely hit of the torpedo boats, however,
was Lieut. (jg) R. W. Brown&rsquo;s 493, which had had
John F. Kennedy aboard, as an instructor, for a
month in Miami. The crew had named the boat
the <i>Carole Baby</i> after the skipper&rsquo;s daughter, who,
incidentally, was celebrating her first birthday the
night of the Battle of Surigao Strait.</p>
<p>Lieut. Brown tells the <i>Carole Baby&rsquo;s</i> story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was assigned a division of boats to take position
directly down the middle of the strait between
Panaon and Dinegat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were under way to take station, the
moon was out but heavy overcast on the horizon
threatened to bring complete darkness later. We
spotted an occasional light on the beach and we
passed an occasional native sailing craft, so the
crew&rsquo;s light mood changed to tension, because they
thought we were being spied on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were on station, strung out across the
channel so that the Japs couldn&rsquo;t get by without
our seeing them, I stretched out on the dayroom
deck for a little relaxation, but the radio crackled
the report that the first PT patrols had made contact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All hands to General Quarters,&rsquo; I ordered.
&lsquo;Take echelon formation and prepare to attack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radarman called up &lsquo;Skipper, eight targets
distant twelve miles, estimated speed 28 knots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We closed to three miles, and seconds later my
number two boat reported its four torpedoes were
in the water. Number Three reported two more
fish off and running. I had been maneuvered out of
firing position and hadn&rsquo;t launched any torpedoes
yet, so I came around for another attack and was
separated from the rest of the section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful searchlights pinpointed the two other
boats, and starshells lit up the night with their ugly
green glare. The two other boats shot up the enemy
can and knocked out two of the lights. I didn&rsquo;t open
fire, because the Japs hadn&rsquo;t seen the <i>Carole Baby</i>
yet and I wanted to shoot my fish before they
found me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At about 500 yards, I fired two and opened up
with my guns. The enemy fired starshells and
turned on the searchlights. At this close range we
could see Japanese sailors scrambling about the
ship, and we poured it into them, but the concussion
of their exploding shells was creeping steadily
closer, so I ordered my executive officer, Nick
Carter, to come hard left, open the throttles and
<span class="smaller">GET OUT</span>!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went aft to release smoke for a screen so we
could return to fire our remaining torpedoes, but we
had penetrated an outer destroyer screen without
knowing it and had Japs all around us. Eight searchlights
pinned us down like a bug on a needle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing how the mind works. I took
time at that moment to notice that all those searchlights
were turning the sea about us to a beautiful
phosphorescent green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our guns blew up two of the searchlights, but
we were being hit hard. A. W. Brunelle reported
from the engine room that the boat was badly
holed at the waterline. I found out later that
he took off his kapok life jacket and stuffed
it into the hole as the only cork he could find
right at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blinding flash and terrific concussion threw
me out of the cockpit. Stunned, I reeled forward
to find that most of the chartroom had been blown
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Nick to head the <i>Carole Baby</i> for the Island
of Panaon, and we limped off with the Jap
cans chasing us. When we were out of torpedo
range of the capital ships, they turned back but
kept throwing shells at us to be sure we didn&rsquo;t return
to attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Return to attack!</i> We weren&rsquo;t even sure we
could stay afloat. The engines were almost completely
underwater and though they were still
working, they couldn&rsquo;t chug along forever with
water steadily rising in the hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last destroyer left us just as the bow of the
<i>Carole Baby</i> scraped on a coral reef one hundred
yards off the beach at Panaon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the shooting stopped, a weird silence
settled over us. I went over the boat to see what
condition we were in. We were in bad condition.
The <i>Carole Baby</i> had been hit by five shells. Two
of them had passed clean through us without exploding,
but the one that had exploded in the
charthouse had killed two and wounded nine of
my crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all. We were high on a reef, within
rock-throwing distance of an enemy shore. I had to
know if those lights we could see came from a
Japanese camp, so I armed ten of us with machine
guns and grenades and we slipped over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found a little village. Somebody had been
there, but had run off as we approached, so we
decided to search farther. This type of warfare
was different from the one the crew was used to,
and everybody was ill at ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that by inference the
sailors were <i>not</i> &ldquo;ill at ease&rdquo; in the type of warfare
they had just been subjected to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the sailors was almost strangled by
what he thought was a low-hanging vine, but we
found it was a telephone wire leading to a small
hut. We crept close to the hut and listened. No
good. Japanese!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;We cut the wire and returned to the safety of
our reef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, consider the character of sailors who talk
about the &ldquo;safety&rdquo; of a shattered boat, filled with
dead and wounded shipmates, stranded on a rock
in the midst of history&rsquo;s greatest naval battle and
within pistol range of an enemy shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expected that wire-cutting bit would stir
up some Jap patrols, so we made ourselves into a
Little Gibraltar with all the weapons we could
scrape together&mdash;and on a PT boat that is plenty
of weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieut. Brown tells of settling down to enjoy the
unaccustomed role of spectator at a battle. Through
the night the crew watched the flash and glare of
gunfire and exploding ships up the straits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t tell who was faring best. Through
binoculars we could see ships afire and sinking, but
we couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were Japanese or American.
Long before dawn the eastern sky looked like sunrise,
because of the orange glow of burning ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When day did break we saw natives creeping
back to their village, so we waved and yelled
&lsquo;<i>Americanos</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>Amigos</i>&rsquo; and friendly stuff like
that. They finally believed us and waded out to our
boat where the sailors set about their eternal
bargaining for souvenirs. I believe an American
sailor would bargain with a cannibal tribe while
they&rsquo;re putting him into the pot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of the crew yelled and pointed out to sea.
Three PTs were roaring up the straits in broad
daylight and we could see what they were after&mdash;it
was the crippled cruiser <i>Mogami</i>, trying to limp
home after the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched one of the PTs fire two fish and then
race toward us when the cruiser fired at her. We
were glad to see her coming, but then we realized
with horror that the skipper thought our poor beat-up
old <i>Carole Baby</i> was a Japanese barge, and he
was getting ready to make a strafing run on us.
We jumped up and down and waved our arms
and yelled like crazy, even though we knew they
couldn&rsquo;t hear us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before they got to the spot where I would
have opened fire if I had been skipper, we saw the
gunners relax and point those gun muzzles away as
they recognized us. It was PT 491 that came to
our rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to pull the <i>Carole Baby</i> off the reef,
but she was too far gone. She went down in deep
water&mdash;the only American ship, incidentally, lost
in the Battle of Surigao Strait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admiral Chester W. Nimitz radioed from
Hawaii:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smaller">THE SKILL, DETERMINATION AND COURAGE DISPLAYED
BY THE PERSONNEL OF THESE SMALL BOATS
IS WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST PRAISE.... THE PT
ACTION VERY PROBABLY THREW THE JAPANESE
COMMAND OFF BALANCE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE
COMPLETENESS OF THEIR SUBSEQUENT DEFEAT.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>By contrast to the corking of Surigao Strait, at
the unguarded San Bernardino Strait, the powerful
Central Striking Force that morning passed unopposed
into Leyte Gulf and jumped the escort
carriers and their screen. Something close to worldwide
panic broke out in American command centers
when the brass realized that the Central
Striking Force was already in the gulf and Admiral
Halsey&rsquo;s force was off chasing the carrier decoy&mdash;too
far off to engage Kurita&rsquo;s fleet.</p>
<p>A handful of destroyers and destroyer escorts
of the screen threw themselves between the Japanese
wolf and the transport sheep. Planes from the
escort carriers made real and dummy bombing
runs on Kurita&rsquo;s ships. Between them the desperate
escort forces&mdash;planes and destroyers&mdash;battled
Kurita to a standstill in the most spectacular show
of sheer fighting courage in all of naval history.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Admiral Kurita, with a victory as
great as Pearl Harbor within his grasp&mdash;the very
victory that the northern decoy carrier force was
being sacrificed to buy&mdash;turned his mighty fleet
about and steamed back through San Bernardino
Strait, content with sinking two of the escort
carriers and three of the screen ships whose gallant
skippers had put their destroyers between the
enemy and the helpless transport fleet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Admiral Halsey sank all four carriers, three destroyers,
one light cruiser and a fleet oiler of the
decoy force.</p>
<p>The <i>Sho</i> plan had worked almost perfectly for
the Japanese&mdash;but with an unexpected outcome;
the Japanese surface fleet, instead of wiping out the
American transport fleet, was shattered. Its carrier
force virtually vanished. His Imperial Japanese
Majesty&rsquo;s navy could never mount a major attack
again.</p>
<p class="tb">With the main battleline of the Japanese fleet
driven from the scene, the PTs were right back
where they had been in New Guinea and Guadalcanal&mdash;busting
barges and derailing the Tokyo
Express.</p>
<p>On the far side of Leyte Island the waters are
reef filled, the channels shallow and tortuous. The
Japanese were using the dangerous waters of the
Camotes Sea and Ormoc Bay to land supplies at
night behind their lines. A familiar enough situation
for the PT sailors, so the skippers took their shallow-draft
torpedo boats into Ormoc Bay, looking
for trouble.</p>
<p>On the night between November 28th and 29th,
Lieut. Roger H. Hallowell took PTs 127, 331, 128,
and 191 around the tip of Leyte and headed up the
western shore for Ormoc Bay in the first combat
patrol of these waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>PTs 127 and 331 entered the bay while the other
two boats patrolled the islands outside. In the light
of a tropical moon, the skippers inside saw a subchaser
and crept to within 800 yards before the
Japanese opened fire. The two boats launched
eight torpedoes and a ripple of rockets (enough
explosive to tear a battleship in two, much less
a little patrol craft). The retiring PT skippers
reported the usual loud explosion, indicating a torpedo
hit, which virtually all retiring torpedo-boat
captains always reported. This time, however,
they were right. The Japanese themselves later admitted
the loss of the subchaser SC 53.</p>
<p>The two retiring boats, all their torpedoes
spent, met the 128 and 191 at the entrance to the
bay, and Lieut. Hallowell &ldquo;transferred his flag&rdquo; to
the 128 to lead the two still-armed boats in a
second attack.</p>
<p>All four boats went in, the two boats with spent
tubes planning to give gunfire support to the armed
duo. All hands searched for the original target,
but could not find it&mdash;for the good reason that
it was on the bottom.</p>
<p>Lieut. Hallowell saw what he thought was a
freighter tied to a dock, so the two skippers, ignoring
fire from the beach, launched all torpedoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Ten days later, when the Army had landed at
Ormoc and taken over the harbor, the PTs promptly
moved in and discovered that Lieut. Hallowell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;freighter&rdquo; was the Japanese PC 105, clearly
visible at the dock, sitting on the bottom with a
fatal gash in her side.</p>
<p class="tb">Lieut. Melvin W. Haines, early on the morning
of December 12th, led PTs 492 and 490 in
a classic attack on a convoy in Ormoc Bay. The
PTs stalked silently to close range, launched torpedoes,
and retired zigzagging behind smoke in a
maneuver right out of the PT textbook. They were
rewarded by a great stab of light behind them.
One of the boats, or perhaps both, had hit the
destroyer <i>Uzuki</i>, which went up in a great column
of orange flame.</p>
<p>This kind of night warfare was only too tediously
familiar to PT sailors, but right then the war took
a nasty new turn for them&mdash;indeed for the whole
Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>Desperate because of the swift deterioration of
their position, the Japanese switched from all
reasonable kinds of warfare&mdash;if there are such&mdash;and
developed the suicidal <i>kamikaze</i> tactic.</p>
<p>Through the war, Japanese fliers&mdash;and Americans,
too, for that matter&mdash;already hit and doomed,
often tried to crash-land on ships under attack,
to take the enemy down to death with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>During the Leyte surface-air battles, however,
many of the Japanese were dedicated, with great
ceremony, to making deliberate suicide dives into
American ships, as a kind of human bomb. The toll
was already frightening to American naval men,
and threatened to get worse.</p>
<p>In mid-December two <i>kamikaze</i> planes crashed
into the 323 in Surigao Strait, and destroyed it
utterly so that the PTs crews were served notice
that they were not too small a prize to merit attention
from the sinister new air fleet.</p>
<p class="tb">MacArthur had returned, all right, when he went
ashore at Leyte, but it was only a kind of tentative
return&mdash;a one-foot-in-the-door return. Until he
landed on Corregidor in Luzon, he wouldn&rsquo;t really
be back where he started. Luzon was the goal.</p>
<p>Just across the narrow Verde Island Passage
from Luzon is the island of Mindoro, and MacArthur&rsquo;s
air commanders sorely coveted that piece
of real estate for airstrips so that they could
bring Luzon under the gunsights of their fighters
before the Luzon landings began.</p>
<p>On December 12th MTB Squadrons Thirteen
and Sixteen, plus PTs 227 and 230, left Leyte Gulf
in a convoy with the Eighth Army&rsquo;s Visayan Task
Force to invade Mindoro Bay, 300 miles to the
northwest. Because of the sharply mounting kamikaze
attacks, the Navy did not want to risk a tender
in Mindoro waters, so the squadrons, with the
help of the ingenious Seabees, planned to set up a
base of sorts on an LST.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>During the afternoon of December 13th, a
<i>kamikaze</i> slipped through the air cover and crashed
into the portside of the invasion force flagship,
the cruiser <i>Nashville</i>. The pilot carried two bombs,
and their explosion touched off five-inch and 40-mm.
ammunition in the ready lockers topside. The
shattering blast killed 133 officers and men, including
both the Army and Navy chiefs of staff and
the colonel commanding the bombardment wing.
The <i>Nashville</i> had to return to Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p>Later, ten more Japanese planes attacked and
one got through to the destroyer <i>Haraden</i>. The
explosion killed 14 sailors and the destroyer had
to go back to Leyte. The PTs huddled close to the
rest of the convoy, to add their batteries to the
curtain of fire.</p>
<p>Troops went ashore on Mindoro at 7 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> on
December 15th, and met little opposition. Half an
hour later, PTs were operating in the harbor. The
infantry quickly set up a perimeter defense, pushing
back the small Japanese garrison to make room
for an airfield at San Jose. As they had at Bougainville,
American planners wanted only enough room
on Mindoro to establish and protect a fighter base.
It was not Mindoro but Luzon that was the
basic goal.</p>
<p>The Japanese didn&rsquo;t intend to let the Americans
have even that much land, however, without
lashing back furiously at the invaders of this
island almost within sight of the city of Manila.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Just after 8 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> the <i>kamikazes</i> arrived. Three
of the planes dove on destroyers and were shot
down by the combined fire of all ships. The fourth
flew over the stern of Ensign J. P. Rafferty&rsquo;s PT
221, caught the full blast of the PT battery, and
cartwheeled along the surface of the bay, spraying
water and flames until it sank from sight.</p>
<p>Outside the bay, the sailors saw the <i>kamikazes</i>
coming, so Lieut. Commander Alvin W. Fargo, Jr.,
commanding Squadron Thirteen, ordered the PTs
still escorting the convoy to get between the LSTs
and the approaching planes. Seven <i>kamikazes</i>
strafed the PTs ineffectively, and the boats brought
down three of them. Of the four that penetrated the
screen, two were shot down by the combined fire
of the LSTs and the PTs. The other two dived
into LST 472 and LST 738, setting them afire. Eventually,
destroyers had to sink the burning hulks with
gunfire. PTs picked up a hundred survivors.</p>
<p>Next morning all the PTs were in Mangarin
Bay at Mindoro, site of the landings, and the LST
605, destined to be their base ship, was unloading
on the beach. PTs 230 and 300 were entering from
the night&rsquo;s patrol, when a single plane glided out
of the sun and strafed the 230, without hitting it.
The <i>kamikaze</i> circled and started his dive on the
LST 605. The landing ship and all the PTs opened
fire and shot off the plane&rsquo;s tail. The <i>kamikaze</i>
crashed on the beach fifty yards from the LST,
killing five men and wounding 11.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Half an hour later eight planes came after the
PTs.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Byron F. Kent, whose 230 was a
target, tells of applying broken-field running football
tactics to the problem:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of the planes chose my boat as their
target. All our fire was concentrated on the first
as it dove for the boat in a gradual sweep, increasing
to an angle of about seventy degrees. I maneuvered
at high speed, to present a starboard
broadside to the oncoming plane. When it was
apparent that the plane could not pull out of the
dive, I feinted in several directions and then turned
hard right rudder under the plane. It struck
the water thirty feet off the starboard bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second plane began its dive. When the pilot
committed himself to his final direction, I swung
the boat away from the plane&rsquo;s right bank. The
plane hit the water fifty feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third plane came in at a seventy-degree
dive. After zigzagging rapidly as the plane came
down, I swung suddenly at right angles. The plane
landed in the water just astern, raising the stern out
of the water and showering the 40-mm. gun crew
with flame, smoke, debris, and water. All of us
were slightly dazed, but there were no injuries and
the boat was undamaged.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Frank A. Tredinnick, in 77, was
attacked by a single. He held a steady course and
speed until just before impact, and then chopped
his throttle. The <i>kamikaze</i> pilot, who had quite
properly taken a lead on the speeding boat, crashed
ten yards ahead.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Harry Griffin, Jr. swung his 223 hard
right just before impact, and his attacker showered
the boat with water.</p>
<p>With two planes after him, Lieut. (jg) J. R.
Erickson maneuvered at top speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gunners fired a steady stream of shells into
one plane as it came down in a steep dive and
crashed fifteen feet off the port bow. The second
plane circled until he saw his partner had missed,
and he dived on our stern, strafing as he came. The
gunners fired on him until he crashed <i>three feet</i>
off the starboard bow, spraying the deck with debris
and water. One man was blown over the side by
the concussion but was rescued uninjured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last plane was shot down by the combined
fire of the PTs before it could even pick a target.</p>
<p>That afternoon as 224 and 297 were leaving for
the night&rsquo;s patrol, two planes dropped three bombs
but missed. The ships in the bay shot one plane
into the water. The other was last seen gliding
over the treetops, trailing fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>On the afternoon of December 17th, three planes
came into the bay. One went into a steep dive
aimed at Lieut. Commander Almer P. Colvin&rsquo;s
300. The <i>kamikaze</i> had been studying the failure of
his comrades, with their suicidal sacrifice, to inflict
any damage on the swift PTs. Lieut. Commander
Colvin gave the 300 a last-second twist to the
right, but the pilot outsmarted him, anticipated
that very move, and crashed into the engine room,
splitting the boat in two. The stem sank immediately
and the bow burned for eight hours. Lieut. Commander
Colvin was seriously wounded, four men
were killed, four reported missing, one officer and
four men wounded. Only one man aboard escaped
without injury.</p>
<p class="tb">That night Lieut. Commander N. Burt Davis&rsquo;
boats carried sealed orders from General MacArthur
to a guerrilla hideout on the other side of Mindoro
and delivered them to Lieut. Commander George
F. Rowe, U. S. Navy liaison officer to the Mindoro
Underground. The boats picked up eleven American
pilots, who had been rescued and sheltered by the
guerrillas, and brought them back to Mindoro.</p>
<p>Some of the Japanese High Command wanted
to write Mindoro off as already lost; others wanted
to make a massive counterlanding on the north
beaches to fight it out at the perimeter defense and
push the American airfield off the island. The two
groups compromised, and as often happens in a
compromise, they sent a boy to do a man&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>Admiral Kimura left Indo-China with a heavy
cruiser, a light cruiser, and four destroyers, on a
mission of bombarding the Mindoro beachhead. It
wasn&rsquo;t much of a naval task force to send into
those waters, but as it happens, every American
capital ship in the area was at Leyte, too far off
to help. The only naval forces handy were the PTs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>The PTs had been up against this very problem
before. Twice, at Guadalcanal, they had tangled
alone with a bombardment force and a far mightier
bombardment force than the one approaching from
Indo-China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recall all patrols to assist in the defense of
Mindoro,&rdquo; Lieut. Admiral Kincaid ordered Lieut.
Commander Davis.</p>
<p>A patrol line of the nine most seaworthy boats
was strung out three miles off the beach. Two more
boats, under Lieut. P. A. Swart, had already left
to call on the Mindoro guerrillas, but Davis
called them back, vectoring them toward the approaching
Japanese, with instructions to attack on
contact.</p>
<p>Army bombers attacked the Japanese bombardment
flotilla all night long (and attacked the patrolling
PTs, too, seriously damaging 77 with a near
miss and wounding every member of the crew&mdash;which
was more than the <i>kamikazes</i> had been able
to do in days of ferocious attack).</p>
<p>Admiral Kimura bombarded the beach for about
thirty minutes. It was a most desultory job, did
almost no damage, and caused not a single casualty.
He fired three poorly aimed salvos at the PTs and
left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Halfway up the western coast of Mindoro, Admiral
Kimura ran into Lieut. Swart&rsquo;s two PTs,
hustling back to get into the scrap. Just after midnight
the two boat skippers and the Japanese discovered
each other simultaneously. The Japanese
illuminated 220 with a searchlight and fired dangerously
accurate salvos&mdash;the first good shooting that
force had done that night.</p>
<p>Lieut. (jg) Harry Griffin, Jr., closed his 223 to
4,000 yards and fired both his starboard fish. Three
minutes later a long lance of flame shot up from
the ship&rsquo;s side and she went under the waves.</p>
<p>The next afternoon PTs picked up five Japanese
sailors from the water. They were survivors of the
brand new destroyer <i>Kiyoshimo</i>, victim of Lieut.
Griffin&rsquo;s steady eye.</p>
<p>The worst ordeal of the Mindoro landings was
prepared on December 27th, when a resupply convoy
shaped up near Dulag on Leyte Island. The convoy
led off with 25 LSTs in five columns of five
ships; next came three Liberty ships, one Navy
tanker, six Army tankers, two aviation gasoline
tankers and the PT tender <i>Orestes</i> in five columns
at the center of the convoy; last came 23 LCIs in
five columns. Nine destroyers formed an outer
screen; 29 PTs formed an inner screen on each
flank.</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Orestes</i> was Captain G. F. Mentz,
commander of the Diversionary Attack Group of
LCIs and PTs which was being moved to Mindoro
for mounting amphibious landings behind the Japanese
lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>A Japanese night snooper spotted the convoy
about 4 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> on December 28th, and at the same
time the convoy commander learned that the
weather was so bad over Leyte airfields that he could
expect no air cover until noon the next day. Unfortunately
the weather was fine over the convoy&mdash;perfect
weather for the <i>kamikazes</i> to draw a bead
on the slow ships of the supply train.</p>
<p>In midmorning three planes attacked. The first
tried to crash-dive the LCIs and was shot down
by LCI 1076. Another overshot the aviation gasoline
tanker <i>Porcupine</i>, and splashed.</p>
<p>The third <i>kamikaze</i> made perhaps the most
spectacular suicide crash of the war. It hit the <i>John
Burke</i>, a merchant ship loaded with ammunition,
and pilot, plane, ship, cargo, and crew disappeared
in a blinding flash. A small Army freighter went
down with the <i>John Burke</i>. The LCI flagship,
LCI 624, ran to the rescue, but only two heads
bobbed in the water, both survivors of the Army
ship, and one of those died almost immediately.
All sixty-eight merchant sailors had been vaporized
in the explosion.</p>
<p>Another <i>kamikaze</i> hit the merchant ship <i>William
Ahearne</i> on the bridge, setting it on fire. The ship
was towed back to Leyte. Loss of this ship was a
sad blow to the forces ashore at Mindoro, for
included in her cargo was a large stock of beer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Friendly air cover arrived and ran off that
particular flight of planes, but the convoy was
under almost constant attack that night. In the
moonlight, about 7 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span>, a torpedo bomber put a
fatal fish into LST 750.</p>
<p>Three LCIs each shot down a plane. Sailors on
the LCI flagship had the harrowing experience of
hearing a torpedo scrape along the ship&rsquo;s flat bottom
from stem to stem without exploding. Some of the
LCIs had surgical units aboard, and many of the
wounded were run over to these handy, impromptu
hospital ships.</p>
<p>Air attack was incessant, in daylight and dark,
and too monotonously similar to recount in detail
unless there was scoring.</p>
<p>During the morning of December 30th, three
planes were shot down, one by a PT that knocked
down its victim as the <i>kamikaze</i> was diving on
an escorting destroyer.</p>
<p>The last attack of the morning came just as
the convoy was entering the harbor at San Jose.
The landing-craft flagship shot down a <i>kamikaze</i>
with a short burst of 40 mm.</p>
<p>Inside Mangarin Bay the ships hurried with the
stevedoring, because the sailors were eager to leave
this unfriendly land. No planes appeared until
almost 4 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Five Japanese dive-bombers pierced the friendly
fighter cover and whistled down from 14,000 feet
in their suicide dives. One hit the destroyer <i>Pringle</i>
and did only light damage. Another hit the aviation
gasoline tanker <i>Porcupine</i> with such an impact
that its engine went clear through the decks and
out the bottom, tearing a large hole in the hull.
Seven men were killed and eight wounded. The
stern burst into flames, a dangerous development on
a ship carrying a tankful of aviation gasoline forward.</p>
<p>The fourth plane dove on the destroyer <i>Gansevoort</i>
and crashed it amidships. The main deck was
peeled back like the lid of an empty sardine can.
The impact cut power lines and set fires, but
caused surprisingly light casualties.</p>
<p>The destroyer <i>Wilson</i> came alongside and exercised
the fire-fighting crew by putting them aboard
the Gansevoort to fight the flames.</p>
<p>The <i>Gansevoort</i> was towed to the PT base.
There she was given the bizarre task of torpedoing
the burning <i>Porcupine</i> to knock off the blazing
stern before the fire reached the gasoline tanks
forward. The trick didn&rsquo;t work, for the blast just
spread burning gasoline on the water, endangering
the <i>Gansevoort</i> herself and setting new fires, so
she had to be towed to a new anchorage. There
she was abandoned, but a volunteer crew of a
nearby PT boarded the destroyer and put out the
fires. <i>Porcupine</i> burned to the waterline.</p>
<p>The most grievous blow of the <i>kamikaze</i> attack,
however, was struck at the PT navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>The fifth Japanese dive bomber dove on the PT
tender <i>Orestes</i>, was hit by tracers from PTs and
LCIs, hit the water and bounced upward into the
starboard side of the tender. The plane&rsquo;s bombs
punched through the side and exploded within,
blowing many officers and men into the bay. The
ship burst into violent flame, and fire mains were
ruptured by the blast. Fifty-nine men were killed
and 106 seriously wounded.</p>
<p>The waters around the <i>Orestes</i> were teeming
with swimming sailors, and PTs bustled about, pulling
in the stunned survivors of the blast.</p>
<p>The LCI 624 went alongside and Commander
A. V. Jannotta, the LCI flotilla commander, led
a volunteer fire-fighting and rescue party aboard the
ship, which had become a hell of exploding ammunition
and burning aviation gasoline.</p>
<p>Commander Jannotta was awarded a Navy
Cross for his heroic salvage work of that afternoon.
Captain Mentz had been severely wounded
in the <i>kamikaze</i> blast, and his chief of staff, Commander
John Kremer, Jr., had been killed, so
Commander Jannotta took over as commander of
the whole task group. He was given a Silver Star
for his performance in that capacity.</p>
<p>Led by Lieut. Commander Davis, many PT
sailors went aboard the burning <i>Orestes</i> to pull
wounded shipmates out of the fire.</p>
<p>By 9:45 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span>, flames were out on the <i>Orestes</i>
and Commander Jannotta lashed an LCI to either
side and pushed it up on the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>At dusk, PTs and LCIs scattered and hugged
the shoreline, to make the worst possible targets
for night marauders. The small craft had good
reason to be shaken. The five <i>kamikazes</i> had made
100 per cent hits, and any weapon that is 100
per cent effective is a fearsome weapon.</p>
<p>That same night four PTs shot down a plane
as they left the bay on patrol.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1945,
bombers came over the base again. One fragmentation
bomb killed 11 men and seriously
wounded ten others, most of them survivors of the
<i>Orestes</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>kamikazes</i> were not through with the
Mindoro shipping. On the afternoon of January 4th,
PTs 78 and 81 set fire to one of four enemy fighters
that flew over the bay. Trailing smoke and flame,
the plane glided into the side of the ammunition
ship <i>Lewis Dyche</i>, anchored a quarter mile from
the two PTs.</p>
<p>The ship exploded with a roar, taking her 71
merchant sailors to the bottom with her and lifting
the PTs out of the water. The concussion
badly damaged the boat hulls; two PT sailors
were killed and ten men wounded by the blast
and falling debris. It was the last visit of the
<i>kamikazes</i> to Mindoro, but a spectacular one.</p>
<p>As Commander Jannotta said in his report:
&ldquo;This new weapon employed by the enemy&mdash;the
suicide diver or human torpedo&mdash;constitutes a
serious threat to naval forces and to shipping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>The Mindoro PTs won a Navy Unit Commendation
which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the only naval force present after retirement
of the invasion convoy, this task unit served
as the major obstruction to enemy counterlandings
from nearby Luzon, Panay, and Palawan,
and bore the brunt of concentrated hostile air
attacks through a five-day period, providing the
only antiaircraft protection available for persons
ashore. The gallant officers and men ... maintained
a vigilant watch by night and stood out
into the open waters close to base by day to fight
off repeated Japanese bombing, strafing, and
suicide attacks, expending in three days the
ammunition which had been expected to last
approximately three weeks in the destruction or
damaging of a large percentage of attacking
planes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When fighter planes began to fly in Mindoro,
Americans went ashore on Luzon. Some hard fighting
remained, but the war was nearing the end.</p>
<p>The last two PTs lost in the war were, sadly
enough, victims of their own mates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>During the landings at Nasugbu, in western
Luzon, on the night of January 31st, ships of the
screen were attacked by twenty or more Japanese
midget submarines. One of the little craft
sank the PC 1129. Immediately afterward the
destroyer escort <i>Lough</i> attacked a swarm of thirty
or more <i>kamikaze</i> explosive boats. Naturally the
screen vessels were nervous about small vessels
in those waters.</p>
<p>On the following night, Lieut. John H. Stillman
set out to hunt the suicide flotillas with PTs 77
and 79. (The 77 had already been treated roughly
by friendlies; it was the boat damaged by American
Army bombers during the repulse of Admiral
Kimura&rsquo;s bombardment flotilla.)</p>
<p>Lieut. Stillman&rsquo;s orders were to stay south of
Talim Point, because the American destroyers
were patrolling north of there. While the PTs were
still three miles south of Talim Point&mdash;well within
their assigned area&mdash;they ran into the destroyer
escort <i>Lough</i>, the same ship that had shot up
the explosive boats the night before, and the destroyer
<i>Conyngham</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Lough</i> fired starshells and the PTs fled
south at high speed, trying to identify themselves by
radio and signal light. The destroyers meanwhile
were trying to raise the boats by radio but failed.
They did not see the PT light signals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>The PTs still might have escaped, but hard
luck 77 picked that evil moment to run aground.
A shell from <i>Lough</i> hit her, blowing the crew into
the water. The <i>Lough</i> shifted fire to 79, and hit
her on the portside. The boat exploded and sank,
carrying down with her the skipper, Lieut. (jg)
Michael A. Haughian, Joseph E. Klesh, MoMM1c,
and Vincent A. Berra, QM3c.</p>
<p>The 30 survivors of the two boats, swimming
in the light of the burning 77, assembled and held a
muster. Besides the three dead on the 79, Lieut.
Stillman was missing. He was never seen again.</p>
<p>The shipwrecked sailors swam together to an
enemy-held shore two miles away. Guerrillas sheltered
them until February 3rd, when they were
picked up by PTs 227 and 230.</p>
<p>On March 2, 1945, just two weeks short of three
years after he left the Rock on Lieut. Bulkeley&rsquo;s PT,
General MacArthur landed on recaptured Corregidor.
Finally, he had returned. And he returned
the same way he had left&mdash;by PT 373.</p>
<p class="tb">In the last days of the war, the PTs fought the
familiar kind of mop-up action against bypassed
pockets of Japanese troops that they had been
fighting for three years in the Pacific. Nightly
patrols fought minor actions, but targets became
harder and harder to find. When the war ended
on August 14, 1945, the Japanese came out of
the woods and the PTs learned for the first
time the tremendous enemy power they had kept
bottled up far from the fighting front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>At Halmahera, for instance, six PTs picked up
Lieut. General Ishii, Commanding General of the
army forces there, and Captain Fujita, Naval
Commander, and took them to 93rd Division
headquarters on Morotai, where they surrendered
37,000 troops, 4,000 Japanese civilians, 19,000
rifles, 900 cannon, 600 machine guns, and a mountain
of miscellaneous supplies.</p>
<p>For almost a year the PTs of Morotai&mdash;down
to two understaffed squadrons at the end&mdash;had
held at bay a Japanese force powerful enough, in
the days of Japanese glory, to conquer whole nations
and to hold vast stretches of conquered lands
in iron control.</p>
<p>The Japanese themselves paid the top tribute
to the PT fleet. &ldquo;The enemy has used PT boats
aggressively,&rdquo; one of their tactical publications read,
&ldquo;On their account our naval ships have had many
a bitter pill to swallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the past of the torpedo boat. What
about its future?</p>
<p>The PT fleet was quickly disbanded after the
war. Today, although the Soviet navy has more than
500 motor torpedo boats&mdash;according to <i>Jane&rsquo;s
Fighting Ships</i>&mdash;and even though Soviet-built torpedo
boats ply Cuban waters almost within sight
of American shores, the U. S. Navy has not a single
PT in commission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>But in the waters of Long Island Sound and
in sheltered bays on the Pacific Coast strange craft
are roaring about&mdash;experimental craft that lift
out of the water to skim along on hydrofoils at
dazzling speeds (though even the modern hydrofoil
cannot attain the breath-taking speeds ascribed
to the PTs by overeager reporters during the days
of the MacArthur rescue run).</p>
<p>The Navy is puttering about with these hydrofoils,
arming them with homing torpedoes, experimenting
with tactics to use against swift nuclear
submarines&mdash;the capital ships of future navies.</p>
<p>There may again be a job in the Navy for the
dashing young sailor who prefers the swift give and
take of small-boat service to the staid and plodding
duty on ships of the line. There may still be room
in America&rsquo;s arsenal for David&rsquo;s giant-killing
slingshot.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Specifications, Armament, and Crew</span></span></h2>
<p>American PT boats, with only a few exceptions,
were of two types, 78-foot Higgins-built boats and
80-foot Elcos. Draft to the tips of propellers was
five feet six inches. Power supply was from three
Packard V-12 engines giving 4,500 shaft horsepower.
Tanks held 3,000 gallons of high-octane gasoline
and 200 gallons of potable water. Normal
crew was three officers and 14 men, though the
complement varied widely under combat conditions.
The boat could carry enough provisions for
about five days. The boat weighed 121,000 pounds,
of which 30,000 were contributed by four torpedoes
and tubes, a 40 mm., two twin 50 caliber, and one
20-mm. antiaircraft gun, one 37-mm. cannon, two
rocket launchers with eight 5-inch rockets, a 60-mm.
mortar, and a smoke-screen generator. In combat,
PT skippers often improvised other armaments to
adapt to local conditions. Pound for pound, the PT
boat was by far the most heavily armed vessel
afloat. Top speed under ideal conditions was 43
knots. Conditions were seldom ideal.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
